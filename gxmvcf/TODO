GXmvcf  --  Gavare's eXperimental Model-View-Controller Framework  --  TODO
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  x)	Core concepts:
		Model, Nodes, Variables
		Actions, Undo/Redo stack
		Views
		Triggers
		Documents

  x)	Model: Tree of nodes
	   x)	Create, remove, move (even between Documents?)
	   x)	Nodes may have subnodes and variables.
	   x)	Nodes and variables have a human-readable path (a string).
	   x)	Cross references are strings, which need to be updated
		by the framework if nodes are renamed/moved.
	   x)	Nodes have implicit serialization/deserialization functions,
		so these do not need to be implemented.

  x)	Triggers/callbacks for changes/write of the model.
	   x)	What kind of triggers? Complex expressions? Sub-tree
		triggers? (e.g. "any change of variable X in any subnodes")

  x)	Not bound to any specific UI; zero or more should be possible:
		x) null (for testing)
		x) console (text)
		x) GTKMM
		x) QT (?)
		x) web
		x) ...

  x)	Undo/redo stack of Actions.
		(An Action is something which modifies the Model.)

  x)	I18N support if glib is included (i.e. string = Glib::ustring).

  x)	Documents saved as XML files by default.
		x)  Some extremely simple other kind of fallback?
		x)  other file formats could be hooked in?
		x)  undo/redo stack saved? (optionally)

  x)	Document "dirty" flag.

  x)	Code examples for easy setup of e.g. a standard GTKMM application.
	   x)	Menu entries for load/save/exit/undo/redo/help/about?


Not planned for first release:

  x)	Support multiple simultaneous Documents.

  x)	Multithreading support (especially for _writing_ to the model).
	   x)	Optional?  pthread?  Others?
