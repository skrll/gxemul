GXmvcf  --  a small Model-View-Controller framework
---------------------------------------------------

GXmvcf is a small MVC (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller)
framework, which can be helpful when creating end-user applications.

Simply put, the Model is your data, independent of how it is presented. 
Your Views are presentation only (reads from the data), and the Controller 
is what holds Model and Views together. Any changes to the Model go via 
the Controller.


GXmvcf's characteristics are:

  o)  Implemented as C++ .h files only. When you wish to build an application
      that uses GXmvcf, you may simply copy the .h files and place them
      in a subdirectory called "gxmvcf".

  o)  BSD-style license.

  o)  Undo/redo history, for all changes to the Model.

  o)  Not bound to any specific UI (e.g. GUI).


When is GXmvcf suitable?

  o)  When you create a new end-user application from scratch, i.e.
      you are not already using any other MVC framework,

  o)  you need to save and load the state of all the application's data
      in files (persistant storage)

  o)  you need undo/redo capability

  o)  you need a clean separation between model (data) and view (UI),
      potentially planning multiple UIs (either graphical or non-
      graphical).


INSTALLATION:

Copy the .h files from src/gxmvcf to your project, and use them.


RUNNING UNIT TESTS:

./configure && make test


BUILDING HTML DOCUMENTATION:

./configure && make documentation
