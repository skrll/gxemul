GXmvcf  --  a small Model-View-Controller framework
---------------------------------------------------

GXmvcf is a small MVC (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller)
framework, which can be helpful when creating end-user applications.

Simply put, the Model is your data, independent of how it is presented. 
Your Views are presentation only (reads from the data), and the Controller 
is what holds Model and Views together. Any changes to the Model go via 
the Controller.

GXmvcf's characteristics are:

  o)  Implemented as C++ .h files only. When you wish to build an application
      that uses GXmvcf, you may simply copy the .h files and place them
      in a subdirectory called "gxmvcf".

  o)  BSD-style license.

  o)  Undo/redo history, for all changes to the Model.

  o)  Not bound to any specific UI (e.g. GUI).

Note:  GXmvcf is still under development, so don't expect it to work yet.
