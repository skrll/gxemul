<h2>Release notes for GXemul 0.5.0</h2>

<p><i>Copyright (C) 2003-2007  Anders Gavare</i>

<p>GXemul is a framework for full-system computer architecture emulation. 
Several processor architectures and machine types have been implemented. 
It is working well enough to allow unmodified "guest" operating systems to 
run inside the emulator, as if they were running on real hardware.

<p>The emulator emulates (networks of) real machines. The machines may 
consist of ARM, MIPS, PowerPC, and SuperH processors, and various 
surrounding hardware components such as framebuffers, busses, interrupt 
controllers, ethernet controllers, disk controllers, and serial port 
controllers.

<p>The documentation lists the machines and guest operating systems that 
can be regarded as "working" in GXemul. The best working guest operating 
systems are NetBSD/pmax and NetBSD/cats.


<p>The changes between release 0.4.6 and 0.5.0 include, among other things:

<ul>

  <li>...

</ul>

<p>Please read the HISTORY file for more details.


<p>Files included in this release are:<pre>
    HISTORY                       Detailed revision history / changelog.
    LICENSE                       Copyright message / license.
    README                        Quick start instructions, for the impatient.
    RELEASE.html                  This file.
    TODO                          TODO notes.
    configure, Makefile.skel      sh and make scripts for building GXemul.
    demos                         Tutorial-like demos of testmachine functionality.
    doc                           Documentation.
    experiments                   Experimental code. (Usually not needed.)
    src                           Source code.
</pre>

<p>To build the emulator, run the <tt>configure</tt> script, and then run 
<tt>make</tt>. This should work on most Unix-like systems, with few or no 
modifications to the source code.

<p>Regarding files in the <tt>src/include/</tt> directory: only some of 
these are written by me, the rest are from other sources (such as NetBSD). 
The license text says that "All advertising materials mentioning features 
or use of this software" must display acknowledgements. Even though I do 
<i>not</i> feel that I mention features or use of the header files (the 
"software") in any advertising materials, I am still very grateful for the 
fact that these people have made their files available for re-use, as Free 
software, so regardless of legal requirements, I guess thanking them like 
this is in order:<pre>
