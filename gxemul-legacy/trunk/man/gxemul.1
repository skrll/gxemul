.Sh NAME
.Nm gxemul
.Nd an experimental framework for full-system machine emulation
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm

.Nm gxemul-gui
.Op options
.Op configfile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
GXemul is a framework for full-system computer architecture emulation.
.Sh USAGE
You can start GXemul using either the gxemul or gxemul-gui binary. The
gxemul-gui binary does not require any additional options. The gxemul binary
requires either the
.Fl V
flag, to start up without an initial emulation, or other command line arguments
that define an emulation.
.Pp
An emulation can be defined using machine selection options, which create an
emulation setup consisting of a machine based on a template, or by loading
an existing emulation setup from a .gxemul configuration file.
.Sh COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
General options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl h
Shows a detailed help message.
.It Fl V
Starts the emulator in the Paused state. This option also makes it possible
to start gxemul without an initial emulation setup. (Note that gxemul-gui can
always be started without an initial emulation.)
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
To start the GUI version of GXemul, type:
.Pp
.Dl "gxemul-gui"
.Pp
To start the text-UI version of GXemul, without any emulation setup configured,
type:
.Pp
.Dl "gxemul -V"
.Pp
If you have a .gxemul configuration file, which you want to run, type:
.Pp
.Dl "gxemul-gui nameofconfig.gxemul"
or
.Dl "gxemul nameofconfig.gxemul"
.Pp
The example above starts the emulation right away. You may add the
.Fl V
option, to start up the emulator in the Paused state instead.
.Pp
TODO: More examples.
.Sh BUGS
There are many bugs, and missing features. Some of the known bugs and missing
features are mentioned in the TODO file in the GXemul source distribution, some
are marked as TODO in the source code itself.
