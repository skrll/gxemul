.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an experimental instruction-level machine emulator. Several
emulation modes are available. In some modes, processors and surrounding
hardware components are emulated well enough to let unmodified operating
systems (e.g. NetBSD) run as if they were running on a real machine.
.Pp
The processor architecture best emulated by GXemul is MIPS, but other
architectures are also partially emulated.
.Pp
There are three ways to invoke the emulator:
.Pp
1. When emulating a complete machine, configuration options can be entered
directly on the command line.
.Pp
2. Options can be read from a configuration file.
.Pp
3. When emulating a userland environment (syscall-only emulation, not
emulating complete machines), then the program name and its argument
should be given on the command line. (This mode doesn't really work yet.)
.Pp
The easiest way to use the emulator is to supply settings directly on the 
command line. The most important thing you need to supply is the
file argument. This is the name of a binary file (an ELF, a.out, COFF/ECOFF,
SREC, or a raw binary image) which you wish to run in the emulator. This file
might be an operating system kernel, or perhaps a ROM image file.
.Pp
If more than one filename is supplied, all files are loaded into memory, 
and the entry point (if available) is taken from the last file.
.Pp
Apart from the name of a binary file, it is also necessary to select
which specific emulation mode to use. For example, a MIPS-based machine
from DEC (a DECstation) is very different from a MIPS-based machine
from SGI. Use
.Nm
.Fl H
to get a list of available emulation modes.
.Pp
There are two exceptions to the normal invocation usage mentioned above.
The first is for DECstation emulation: if you have a bootable
DECstation harddisk or CDROM image, then just supplying the diskimage via 
the
.Fl d
option is sufficient. (The filename of the kernel can then be 
skipped, as the emulator runs the bootblocks from the diskimage directly and 
doesn't need the kernel as a separate file.)
The second is if you supply an ISO9660 CDROM disk image. You may then use 
the
.Fl j
option to indicate which file on the CDROM filesystem that should be 
loaded into emulated memory.
.Pp
Machine selection options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl E Ar t
Try to emulate machine type
.Ar "t".
This option is not always needed, if the
.Fl e
option uniquely selects a machine.
(Use
.Fl H
to get a list of types.)
.It Fl e Ar st
Try to emulate machine subtype
.Ar "st".
Use this together with
.Fl E .
(This option is not always needed, if a machine type has no subtypes.)
.El
.Pp
Other options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl A
Disable load/store alignment checks in some cases. This might give a small
increase in performance, but the emulator will not run correctly if the 
emulated code actually tries to do unaligned loads or stores. (This option 
is only meaningful when emulating MIPS CPUs, when the host architecture is 
Alpha or i386, and binary translation is enabled.)
.It Fl B
Disable dynamic binary translation. By default, bintrans
will be turned on if the host+target architecture combination is 
supported. Currently, the only supported target architecture for bintrans 
is MIPS, and the supported host architectures are Alpha and i386.
.It Fl C Ar x
Try to emulate a specific CPU type,
.Ar "x".
This overrides the default CPU type for the machine being emulated.
(Use
.Fl H
to get a list of available CPU types.)
.It Fl d Ar name
Add
.Ar name
as a disk image. By adding one or more modifier characters and then a
colon (":") as a prefix to
.Ar "name",
you can modify the way the disk image is treated. Available modifiers are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It b
Specifies that this is a boot device.
.It c
CD-ROM.
.It d
DISK (this is the default).
.It f
FLOPPY.
.It gH;S;
Override the default geometry; use H heads and S sectors-per-track.
(The number of cylinders is calculated automatically.)
.It i
IDE.
.It r
Read-only (don't allow changes to be written to the file).
.It s
SCSI (this is the default for most machine types).
.It t
Tape.
.It 0-7
Force a specific ID number.
.El
.Pp
Unless otherwise specified, filenames ending with ".iso" or ".cdr" are 
assumed to be CDROM images. Most others are assumed to be disks. Depending
on which machine is being emulated, the default for disks can be either 
SCSI or IDE. Some disk images that are very small are assumed to be floppy 
disks. (If you are not happy with the way a disk image is detected, then 
you need to use explicit prefixes to force a specific type.)
.Pp
For floppies, the gH;S; prefix is ignored. Instead, the number of 
heads and cylinders are assumed to be 2 and 80, respectively, and the 
number of sectors per track is calculated automatically. (This works for 
720KB, 1.2MB, 1.44MB, and 2.88MB floppies.)
.It Fl I Ar x
Emulate clock interrupts at
.Ar x
Hz. (This affects emulated clock devices only, not actual runtime speed.
This disables automatic clock adjustments, which is otherwise turned on.)
(This option is probably only valid for DECstation emulation.)
.It Fl i
Display each instruction as it is being executed.
.It Fl J
Disable some speed tricks.
.It Fl j Ar n
Set the name of the kernel to
.Ar "n".
When booting from an ISO9660 filesystem, the emulator will try to boot 
using this file. (In some emulation modes, eg. DECstation, this name is passed 
along to the boot program. Useful names are "bsd" for OpenBSD/pmax, 
or "vmunix" for Ultrix.)
.It Fl M Ar m
Emulate
.Ar m
MBs of physical RAM. This overrides the default amount of RAM for the 
selected machine type.
.It Fl m Ar nr
Run at most
.Ar nr
instructions (on any cpu).
.It Fl N
Display nr of instructions/second average, at regular intervals.
.It Fl n Ar nr
Set nr of CPUs (for SMP experiments).
.It Fl O
Force a "netboot" (tftp instead of disk), even when a disk image is
present (for DECstation, SGI, and ARC emulation).
.It Fl o Ar arg
Set the boot argument (mostly useful for DEC, ARC, or SGI emulation).
Default
.Ar arg
for DEC is "-a", for ARC/SGI it is "-aN", and for CATS it is "-A".
.It Fl p Ar pc
Add a breakpoint. (Remember to use the "0x" prefix for hex.)
.It Fl Q
Disable the built-in PROM emulation. This is useful for running raw ROM
images from real machines.
.It Fl R
Use a random bootstrap cpu, instead of CPU nr 0. (For SMP experiments.)
.It Fl r
Dump register contents for every executed instruction.
.It Fl S
Initialize the emulated RAM to random data, instead of zeroes.
.It Fl T
Enter the single-step debugger on unimplemented memory accesses.
.It Fl t
Show a trace tree of all function calls being made.
.It Fl U
Enable slow_serial_interrupts_hack_for_linux.
.It Fl X
Use X11.
.It Fl x
Open up new xterms for emulated serial ports. (Default is to open up 
xterms when using configuration files, but not when starting an 
emulation with settings directly on the command line.)
.It Fl Y Ar n
Scale down framebuffer windows by
.Ar n
x
.Ar n
times.
.It Fl y Ar x
Set max_random_cycles_per_chunk to
.Ar x
(experimental).
.It Fl Z Ar n
Set the number of graphics cards, for emulating a dual-head or tripple-head
environment. (Only for DECstation emulation so far.)
.It Fl z Ar disp
Add
.Ar disp
as an X11 display to use for framebuffers.
.El
.Pp
Userland options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl u Ar emul-mode
Userland-only (syscall) emulation. (Use
.Fl H
to get a list of available emulation modes.) Some (but not all) of the
options listed under Other options above can also be used with userland
emulation.
.El
.Pp
General options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl D
Guarantee fully deterministic behavior. Normally, the emulator calls
srandom() with a seed based on the current time at startup. When the
.Fl D
option is used, the srandom() call is skipped, which should cause two 
subsequent invocations of the emulator to be identical, if all other 
settings are identical and no user input is taking place. (If this option 
is used, then
.Fl I
must also be used.)
.It Fl H
Display a list of available CPU types, machine types, and userland
emulation modes. (Most of these don't work. Please read the documentation
included in the
.Nm
distribution for details on which modes that actually work.)
.It Fl h
Display a list of all available command line options.
.It Fl K
Force the single-step debugger to be entered at the end of a simulation.
.It Fl q
Quiet mode; this suppresses startup messages.
.It Fl s
Show opcode usage statistics after the simulation.
.It Fl V
Start up in the single-step debugger, paused.
.It Fl v
Verbose debug messages.
.El
.Pp
Configuration file startup:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It @ Ar configfile
Start an emulation based on the contents of
.Ar "configfile".
.El
.Pp
For more information, please read the documentation in the doc/
subdirectory of the
.Nm
distribution.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following command will start NetBSD/pmax on an emulated DECstation 
5000/200 (3MAX):
.Pp
.Dl "gxemul -e 3max -d nbsd_pmax.img"
.Pp
nbsd_pmax.img should be a raw disk image containing a bootable 
NetBSD/pmax filesystem.
.Pp
The following command will start an emulation session based on settings in 
the configuration file "mysession". The -v option tells gxemul to be
verbose.
.Pp
.Dl "gxemul -v @mysession"
.Pp
If you have compiled the small Hello World program mentioned in the
.Nm
documentation, the following command will start up an
emulated test machine in "paused" mode:
.Pp
.Dl "gxemul -E testmips -V hello_mips"
.Pp
(Paused mode means that you enter the interactive single-step debugger
directly at startup, instead of launching the Hello World program.)
.Pp
Please read the documentation for more details.
.Sh BUGS
There are many bugs. Some of the known bugs are listed in the BUGS
file in the
.Nm
source distribution, some are indirectly mentioned in the TODO file,
and some are mentioned in the source code itself.
.Pp
The binary translation subsystem is really terrible, but it is less
terrible than running without it.
.Pp
Userland (syscall-only) emulation doesn't really work yet.
.Pp
Emulation of MIPS CPUs is done differently from other emulation modes; the 
documentation sometimes only reflect the way things work with MIPS 
emulation, and it is incorrect when applied to e.g. ARM emulation.
.Pp
.Nm
does not simulate individual pipe-line stages or penalties caused by
branch-prediction misses or cache misses, so it cannot be used for
accurate simulation of any actual real-world processor.
.Pp
.Nm
is not timing-accurate.
