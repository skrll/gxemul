.Sh NAME
.Nm gxemul
.Nd an experimental framework for full-system machine emulation
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op configfile
.Nm gxemul-gui
.Op configfile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
GXemul is a framework for full-system computer architecture emulation.
TODO.
.Sh BUGS
There are many bugs. Some of the known bugs are mentioned in the TODO 
file in the
.Nm
source distribution, some are marked as TODO in the source code itself.
.Pp
.Nm
is in general not cycle-accurate; it does not simulate individual
pipe-line stages or penalties caused by branch-prediction misses or
cache misses, so it cannot be used for accurate simulation of any actual
real-world processor.
.Pp
.Nm
is in general not timing-accurate. Many emulation modes try to make the
guest operating system's clock run at the same speed as the host clock.
However, the number of instructions executed per clock tick can
obviously vary, depending on the current CPU load on the host.
