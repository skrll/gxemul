.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mips64emul
is a MIPS machine emulator. The goals are to emulate
MIPS-like CPUs and enough surrounding hardware to let unmodified operating
systems run as if they were running on a real machine, and to assist in
experiments involving MIPS-like code in general.

Run
.B mips64emul \-h
to get a list of available command line options.
You should also read the documentation provided in the
.B doc/
subdirectory of the
.B mips64emul
distribution.

There are two ways to invoke the emulator: settings can be entered 
directly on the command line, or they can be read from a configuration 
file. Please read the documentation for more information about the 
configuration files.

The easiest way to use the emulator is to supply settings directly on the 
command line. The most important thing you need to supply is the
.I file
argument. This is the name of a MIPS binary file (an ELF32, ELF64,
a.out, ECOFF, SREC, or a raw binary image) which you wish to run in the 
emulator. This file might be an operating system kernel, or perhaps a ROM 
image file.

Apart from the name of a MIPS binary, it is also necessary to select
which specific emulation mode to use. For example, a MIPS-based machine
from DEC (a DECstation) is very different from a MIPS-based machine
from SGI.

(There is an exception to the normal invocation usage mentioned above;
if you want to use the DECstation emulation mode, and have a bootable
DECstation harddisk or CDROM image, then just supplying the diskimage via 
the -d option is sufficient. The filename of the kernel can then be 
skipped, as the emulator runs the bootblocks from the diskimage directly and 
doesn't need the kernel as a separate file.)
.SH EXAMPLES
The following command will start NetBSD/pmax on an emulated DECstation 
5000/200, with dynamic binary translation enabled:
.nf

	mips64emul \-D2 \-b \-d netbsddisk.img

.fi
netbsddisk.img should be a raw disk image containing a NetBSD/pmax
filesystem.

The following command will start an emulation session based on settings in 
the configuration file "mysession". The -v option tells mips64emul to be
verbose.
.nf

	mips64emul \-v @mysession

.fi

Please read the documentation for more details.
