I'm currently working on what will become 0.2.2.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

mips64emul 0.2.2
================

Copyright (C) 2003-2004  Anders Gavare.


Overview
--------

mips64emul is a MIPS machine emulator. The goals are to emulate MIPS-like
CPUs and enough surrounding hardware to be able to run unmodified
operating systems (such as NetBSD, Ultrix, Linux, FreeBSD, or OpenBSD) as 
if they were running on a real machine, and to assist in experiments
involving MIPS-like code in general.

(MIPS is a registered trademark of MIPS Technologies. This project is not
affiliated with MIPS Technologies in any way whatsoever.)


Quick start
-----------

To compile, type './configure' and then 'make'.  This should work on most
Unix-like systems, if not then please mail me a bug report.

Please read the the documentation in the doc/ sub-directory for more detailed
information on how to use the emulator.


Feedback
--------

If you have found mips64emul useful in some way, or found a bug which is 
not already listed in the BUGS or TODO files, then don't hesitate to send 
feedback to md1gavan(at)mdstud.chalmers.se.
