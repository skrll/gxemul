Version 0.1.1 of the emulator was released at 2004-07-02.  The next
stable release will probably not happen very soon, as there are lots of
things I'd like to experiment with that might make the code unstable.

I'll probably call the next release 0.2, since it will be different enough
from the 0.1 and 0.1.1 releases to warrant a big version increase.


Preliminary 0.2 README:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
mips64emul 0.2
==============


Overview
--------

mips64emul is a MIPS machine emulator. The goals are to emulate 64-bit and
32-bit MIPS-like CPUs and enough surrounding hardware to fake real machines,
capable of running real (unmodified) operating systems, such as NetBSD, Linux,
or OpenBSD. This is a spare time hobby project, and many things are not
implemented yet.

(MIPS is a registered trademark of MIPS Technologies. This project is not
affiliated with MIPS Technologies in any way whatsoever.)


Quick start
-----------

To compile, type './configure' and then 'make'.  This should work on most
Unix-like systems, if not then please mail me a bug report.

Please read the the documentation in the doc/ sub-directory for more detailed
information.
