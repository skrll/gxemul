------------------------------------------------------------------------------

mips64emul 0.2.X
================

Copyright (C) 2003-2005  Anders Gavare.


Overview
--------

mips64emul is a free MIPS machine emulator. The goals are to emulate MIPS-like
processors and enough surrounding hardware to let unmodified operating systems
run as if they were running on a real machine, and to assist in experiments
involving MIPS-like code in general.

(MIPS is a registered trademark of MIPS Technologies. mips64emul is developed
as a spare-time hobby, and there is no affiliation with MIPS Technologies in
any way whatsoever.)


Quick start
-----------

To compile, type './configure' and then 'make'.  This should work on most Unix-
like systems, if not then please mail me a bug report.

Please read the the documentation in the doc/ sub-directory for more detailed
information on how to use the emulator.


Feedback
--------

If you have found mips64emul useful in some way, or feel like sending be
comments or feedback in general, then send mail to anders(at)gavare.se.
