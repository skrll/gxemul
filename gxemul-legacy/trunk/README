mips64emul 0.2.1
================

Copyright (C) 2003-2004 by Anders Gavare  (md1gavan@mdstud.chalmers.se)


Overview
--------

mips64emul is a MIPS machine emulator. The goals are to emulate MIPS-like CPUs
and enough surrounding hardware to fake real machines, capable of running real
(unmodified) operating systems, such as NetBSD, Linux, FreeBSD, or OpenBSD, and
to assist in experiments involving MIPS-like code in general.

This is a spare time hobby project, and many things are not implemented yet.

(MIPS is a registered trademark of MIPS Technologies. This project is not
affiliated with MIPS Technologies in any way whatsoever.)


Quick start
-----------

To compile, type './configure' and then 'make'.  This should work on most
Unix-like systems, if not then please mail me a bug report.

Please read the the documentation in the doc/ sub-directory for more detailed
information on how to use the emulator.


Feedback
--------

Send comments to md1gavan@mdstud.chalmers.se.
