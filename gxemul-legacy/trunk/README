mips64emul
==========


Overview
--------

mips64emul is a MIPS machine emulator.  The goal is to emulate MIPS-like CPUs
and enough surrounding hardware well enough to run unmodified operating systems
as if they were running on real machines.  This is a spare time hobby project,
and many things are not implemented yet.


Quick start
-----------

To compile, type './configure' and then 'make'.  (This should work on most
Unix-like systems, if not then please mail me a bug report.)

Please read the the documentation in the doc/ sub-directory for more detailed
information.

--------
