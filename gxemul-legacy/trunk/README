Gavare's eXperimental Emulator   --   GXemul 0.3.X
==================================================

Copyright (C) 2003-2006  Anders Gavare.


Overview
--------

GXemul is an experimental instruction-level machine emulator. Several
emulation modes are available. In some modes, processors and surrounding
hardware components are emulated well enough to let unmodified operating
systems (e.g. NetBSD) run as if they were running on a real machine.

MIPS processors are emulated using either a simple binary translation 
layer ("recompilation"), which is used on Alpha and i386 hosts, or by 
traditional interpretation (very very slow, but works on any host platform).

ARM and PowerPC processors are emulated using a newer dynamic translation
system. Performance is somewhere between traditional interpretation and
dynamic recompilation; however, the dynamic translation system used in
GXemul does NOT require platform-specific back-end code. In plain English,
this means that the dyntrans system works on any host platform.


Quick start
-----------

To compile, type './configure' and then 'make'. This should work on most
Unix-like systems. If not, then please mail me a bug report.

If you are impatient, and want to try out running a guest operating system 
inside GXemul, please read this:  doc/guestoses.html#netbsdinstall

If you want to use GXemul for experimenting with code of your own, 
then I suggest you compile a Hello World program according to the tips 
listed here:  doc/experiments.html#hello

Please read the rest of the documentation in the doc/ sub-directory for
more detailed information on how to use the emulator.


Feedback
--------

If you have found GXemul useful in some way, or feel like sending me
comments or feedback in general, then mail me at anders(at)gavare.se.
