mips64emul 0.2
==============

Copyright (C) 2003-2004 by Anders Gavare  (md1gavan@mdstud.chalmers.se)


Overview
--------

mips64emul is a MIPS machine emulator. The goals are to emulate MIPS-like CPUs
and enough surrounding hardware to fake real machines, capable of running real
(unmodified) operating systems, such as NetBSD, Linux, or OpenBSD, and to
assist in experiments involving MIPS-like code in general.

This is a spare time hobby project, and many things are not implemented 
yet.

(MIPS is a registered trademark of MIPS Technologies. This project is not
affiliated with MIPS Technologies in any way whatsoever.)


Quick start
-----------

To compile, type './configure' and then 'make'.  This should work on most
Unix-like systems, if not then please mail me a bug report.

Please read the the documentation in the doc/ sub-directory for more detailed
information on how to use the emulator.


Feedback
--------

Send feedback to:  md1gavan at mdstud.chalmers.se.
