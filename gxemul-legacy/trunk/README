I'm now working on what will be 0.3.3.

Gavare's eXperimental Emulator   --   GXemul 0.3.3
==================================================

Copyright (C) 2003-2005  Anders Gavare.


Overview
--------

GXemul is an experimental instruction-level machine emulator. It can be
used to run binary code for (among others) MIPS-based machines. Several
emulation modes are available. For some emulation modes, processors and
surrounding hardware components are emulated well enough to let unmodified
operating systems (eg. NetBSD) run as if they were running on a real machine.


Quick start
-----------

To compile, type './configure' and then 'make'. This should work on most
Unix-like systems. If not, then please mail me a bug report.

Please read the the documentation in the doc/ sub-directory for more
detailed information on how to use the emulator.


Feedback
--------

If you have found GXemul useful in some way, or feel like sending me
comments or feedback in general, then mail me at anders(at)gavare.se.
