I'm now working on post-0.3.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GXemul 0.3.X
============

Copyright (C) 2003-2005  Anders Gavare.


Overview
--------

GXemul is a machine emulator, which can be used to experiment with binary code
for (among others) MIPS-based machines. Several emulation modes are available.
For some emulation modes, processors and surrounding hardware components are
emulated well enough to let unmodified operating systems run as if they were
running on a real machine.


Quick start
-----------

To compile, type './configure' and then 'make'.  This should work on most Unix-
like systems, if not then please mail me a bug report.

Please read the the documentation in the doc/ sub-directory for more detailed
information on how to use the emulator.


Feedback
--------

If you have found GXemul useful in some way, or feel like sending me comments
or feedback in general, then mail me at anders(at)gavare.se.
