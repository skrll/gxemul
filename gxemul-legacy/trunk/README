mips64emul
==========

mips64emul is a MIPS CPU emulator.  The goal is to simulate a MIPS CPU and
enough surrounding hardware well enough to run unmodified operating systems
as if they were running on a real machine.  This is a spare time project,
and the emulator isn't fully functional yet.

To compile, type './configure' and then 'make'.

A test program can be rebuilt by typing 'make test', if you have
a cross-compiler suite set up with the same names as the Makefile
uses, but the test program is not neccesary for the emulator to work.

Real operating system kernels can be downloaded from various places.
Here are examples of kernels that can be experimented with:

  ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.6.1/pmax/binary/kernel/netbsd-INSTALL.gz
  Suitable command line arguments may be  -D2 -q -XY2 -M16 -I1000000
  for a graphical framebuffer console, or  -D2 -q -M16 -I1000000 for
  serial (stdin/stdout) console.

  ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/2.8/pmax/bsd
  This is an old OpenBSD kernel in a.out format.
  Try running with  -D1 or -D2.

  ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.6.1/cobalt/binary/kernel/
  Try running with  -E.

  http://people.debian.org/~pm/mips-cobalt/nfsroot/vmlinux_raq-2800.gz
  gunzip, and then try running with -E.

  A NetBSD/playstation2 snapshot kernel is available here:
  ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/playstation2/snapshot/20020327/installation/
  Try running with  -X -B      (-X is required, for the framebuffer).

  An ARC linux kernel, ECOFF:  (try running with -A)
  ftp://ftp.linux-mips.org/pub/linux/mips/mipsel-linux/boot/vmlinux-m700-2.1.131.gz

NOTE:  Add a  -q  to the command line options to supress debug messages.
       Add  -X  to use a X-windows framebuffer, if the emulated machine
       supports that.  (You can add  -Y2  to scale down the framebuffer
       window a bit.)
