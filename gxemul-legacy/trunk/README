I'm now working on what will become 0.2.4.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

mips64emul 0.2.4
================

Copyright (C) 2003-2004  Anders Gavare.


Overview
--------

mips64emul is a free MIPS machine emulator. The goals are to emulate
MIPS-like CPUs and enough surrounding hardware to let unmodified operating
systems run as if they were running on a real machine, and to assist in
experiments involving MIPS-like code in general.

(MIPS is a registered trademark of MIPS Technologies. mips64emul is 
developed as a spare-time hobby, and there is no affiliation with MIPS
Technologies in any way whatsoever.)


Quick start
-----------

To compile, type './configure' and then 'make'.  This should work on most
Unix-like systems, if not then please mail me a bug report.

Please read the the documentation in the doc/ sub-directory for more detailed
information on how to use the emulator.


Feedback
--------

If you have found mips64emul useful in some way, or found a bug which is 
not already listed in the BUGS or TODO files, then don't hesitate to send 
feedback to anders(at)gavare.se
