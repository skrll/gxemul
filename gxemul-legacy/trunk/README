mips64emul 0.1.1
================


Overview
--------

mips64emul is a MIPS machine emulator. The goals are to emulate 32-bit and
64-bit MIPS-like CPUs and enough surrounding hardware to fake real machines,
capable of running real (unmodified) operating systems, such as NetBSD or
Linux. This is a spare time hobby project, and many things are not
implemented yet.

(MIPS is a registered trademark of MIPS Technologies. This project is not

Quick start
-----------

To compile, type './configure' and then 'make'.  This should work on most
Unix-like systems, if not then please mail me a bug report.

Please read the the documentation in the doc/ sub-directory for more detailed
information.
