mips64emul
==========

mips64emul is a MIPS CPU emulator.  The goal is to simulate a MIPS CPU and
enough surrounding hardware well enough to run unmodified operating systems
as if they were running on a real machine.  This is a spare time project,
and the emulator isn't fully functional yet.

To compile, type './configure' and then 'make'.

A test program can be rebuilt by typing 'make test', if you have
a cross-compiler suite set up with the same names as the Makefile
uses, but the test program is not neccesary for the emulator to work.

Real operating system kernels can be downloaded from various places.
Here are examples of kernels that can be experimented with:


o)  DECstation:

    ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.6.1/pmax/binary/kernel/netbsd-INSTALL.gz
    gunzip the file, and run:   ./mips64emul -D2 -q -XY2 -M16 -I1000000 netbsd-INSTALL
    for a graphical framebuffer console, or use -D2 -q -M16 -I1000000 for
    serial (stdin/stdout) console.

    ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/2.8/pmax/bsd
    This is an old OpenBSD kernel in a.out format.
    Try running with -q -D1 or -D2.

    http://www.xs4all.nl/~vhouten/mipsel/kernels.html
    Linux kernels. Try with -q -D1, -D2, -D7, or -D12.


o)  SGI:

    NetBSD/sgimips:  (gunzip, and try running with  -G32 -q)
    ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.6.1/sgimips/binary/kernel/netbsd-INSTALL.gz

    Linux/SGI kernels:  (-G32 -q)
    http://www.linux-mips.org/~glaurung/
    You need to add  -CR10000  to the command line for the R10000 kernel.


o)  ARC:

    NetBSD/arc:  (gunzip, and try running with  -Aq  or  -XAq)
    ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.6.1/arc/binary/kernel/netbsd.RAMDISK.gz

    An ARC linux kernel, ECOFF:  (gunzip, and try running with -A)
    ftp://ftp.linux-mips.org/pub/linux/mips/mipsel-linux/boot/vmlinux-m700-2.1.131.gz


o)  Cobalt:

    ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.6.1/cobalt/binary/kernel/
    Try running with  -E -q.

    http://people.debian.org/~pm/mips-cobalt/nfsroot/vmlinux_raq-2800.gz
    gunzip, and then try running with -E.


o)  Playstation 2:

    A NetBSD/playstation2 snapshot kernel is available here:
    ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/playstation2/snapshot/20020327/installation/
    Try running with  -X -B -q      (-X is required, for the framebuffer).


NOTE:  Add a  -q  to the command line options to supress debug messages.
       Add  -X  to use a X-windows framebuffer, if the emulated machine
       supports that.  (You can add  -Y2  to scale down the framebuffer
       window a bit.)
