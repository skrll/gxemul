I'm now working on post-0.3.

mips64emul 0.3
==============

Copyright (C) 2003-2005  Anders Gavare.


Overview
--------

mips64emul is a MIPS machine emulator, which can be used in experiments
involving MIPS binary code. Several emulation modes are available. For some 
emulation modes, processors and surrounding hardware components are emulated    
well enough to let unmodified operating systems run as if they were running on  
a real machine.


Quick start
-----------

To compile, type './configure' and then 'make'.  This should work on most Unix-
like systems, if not then please mail me a bug report.

Please read the the documentation in the doc/ sub-directory for more detailed
information on how to use the emulator.


Feedback
--------

If you have found mips64emul useful in some way, or feel like sending be
comments or feedback in general, then send mail to anders(at)gavare.se.
