	    =====================================================

	        THERE IS NO ACTUAL RELEASE OF mips64emul YET!

	    =====================================================


Only development snapshots of what I have in CVS.  However, I plan to make
an official release some time in the future.

The following things have to work before a release to become a reality:

	o)  Diskimages need to be usable under at least some emulation modes,
	    preferably DECstations (the 'asc' SCSI controller), but others
	    would be nice as well,
		DONE: Partly. It needs to be fixed to work on more DECstation
		models, and with more OSes

	o)  it must be possible to install an entire operating system within
	    the emulator, and possibly even compile and run mips64emul
	    _inside_ the emulated environment,
		DONE: NetBSD/pmax and Ultrix 4.5 both seem to install
		without errors on the -D2 model.
		The emulator compiles just fine inside NetBSD/pmax, and
		runs (although very slowly).

	o)  regression tests  (yes, the skeleton is there, but it isn't used
	    yet),
		NO, I guess I'll skip this.

	o)  the code needs to stabilize in general.


The following will most definitely NOT be included in the first release:

	o)  binary translation

	o)  GUI


Then, to make an official release:

	o)  Try mips64emul on as many combinations as possible of the
	    following variables:

		x)  Host OS  (Linux, *BSD, Solaris, others?)
		x)  Host hardware (alpha, i386, mips :-), sparc, ...)
		x)  emulation mode   (DECstation, SGI?, ..)
		    and regression tests (if possible)
		x)  OSes running under emulation (NetBSD, OpenBSD,
		    Linux, Ultrix?, Irix?, ..)

		For each Host platform:
			o)  does it configure correctly?  (try multiple
				compilers)
			o)  does it build?  (make)
			o)  does it run?  (try multiple guest kernels/OSes)
			o)  does it support X11?
			o)  any bugs while running?

	o)  Documentation.
		x)  doc/
		x)  release file
		x)  man page?

	o)  Make sure all URLs on the project homepage and in the
	    documentation are valid.

	o)  General clean-up.

:-)

These platforms were tested at one time or another, and should be tested
again before a release is made:

	FreeBSD/alpha 4.9
		gcc version 2.95.4 20020320 [FreeBSD]
		gcc version 3.3.1 [FreeBSD]
		ccc 6.4.9.005-1

	Linux/i386
		gcc version 3.2.2 20030222 (Red Hat Linux 3.2.2-5)

	OpenBSD/i386
		gcc (which version?)

	OpenBSD/sparc64
		gcc (which version?)

	Solaris/sparc (SunOS 5.9)
		cc Sun WorkShop 6 update 2 C 5.3 Patch 111679-12 2003/05/18
		gcc version 2.95.3 20010315 (release)

	NetBSD/pmax  (inside the emulator itself)
		default gcc seems to work

	Ultrix/MIPS  (inside the emulator itself)
		(default cc doesn't seem to work)

	HP-UX B.11.00
		gcc 3.3.2
		(default cc doesn't seem to work)

Release notes for mips64emul 0.1
================================

Copyright (C) 2003-2004 by Anders Gavare  (md1gavan@mdstud.chalmers.se)


This is the first official release of mips64emul.

mips64emul is a MIPS machine emulator. The goals are to emulate 32-bit and
64-bit MIPS-like CPUs and enough surrounding hardware to fake real machines,
capable of running real (unmodified) operating systems, such as NetBSD or
Linux.

(MIPS is a registered trademark of MIPS Technologies. This project is not
affiliated with MIPS Technologies in any way whatsoever.) 

Please report bugs to me.  This release has a number of known bugs, listed
in the BUGS file, but feel free to drop me a line regarding other bugs.

Only a few files in the include/ directory are written by me, the rest are
from other sources (such as NetBSD).  The license text says that "All
advertising materials mentioning features or use of this software" must
display acknowledgements.  Even though I do NOT feel I mention features or
use of the header files (the "software") in any advertising materials, I am
still very greatful for the fact that these people have made their files
freely available, so I guess thanking them like this is in order:
