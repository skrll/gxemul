Release notes for mips64emul 0.3
================================

Copyright (C) 2003-2005  Anders Gavare.


mips64emul is a MIPS machine emulator, which can be used in experiments
involving MIPS binary code. Several emulation modes are available. For some
emulation modes, processors and surrounding hardware components are emulated
well enough to let unmodified operating systems run as if they were running on
a real machine.


The emulator can be used for many different things. One of the most interesting
uses is to run complete "guest" operating systems. I have verified that the
following operating systems can run inside the emulator:


       Guest operating system               Emulated machine
       ----------------------               ----------------

       NetBSD/pmax 2.0 (and 1.6.2)          DECstation 5000/200
       OpenBSD/pmax 2.8-BETA                DECstation 5000/200
       Ultrix 4.2-4.5                       DECstation 5000/200
       Sprite demo harddisk image           DECstation 5000/200
       Debian GNU/Linux for DECstation      DECstation 5000/200
       Redhat Linux 7.1 for mips            DECstation 5000/200
       NetBSD/arc 1.6.2                     Acer PICA-61
       OpenBSD/arc 2.3                      Acer PICA-61


A couple of other emulation modes exist (for SGI's MIPS-based machines,
Playstation 2, Cobalt, some other ARC machines, etc) but these modes are more
of a curiosity, and should not be considered working yet.

Apart from running guest operating systems, the emulator can also be used for
other experiments with MIPS-like code.


Summary of changes from version 0.2.4.1 to 0.3:

	x)  I've performed a major code clean-up.

	x)  Support for using "configuration files" has been added, so
	    settings do not have to be entered on the command line anymore.
	    (Useful for complex emulation setups.)

	x)  Multiple machines can now be emulated simultaneously.

	x)  Some seldomly used command line options have been changed or
	    removed, but 0.3 should be mostly backward compatible with
	    0.2.4.1.

	x)  Many bugfixes, too many to mention here.


This release has a number of known bugs, listed in the BUGS file, but feel
free to drop me an email regarding other bugs.


Files included in this release are:

  BUGS                        A list of known bugs.
  HISTORY                     Detailed revision history / changelog.
  LICENSE                     Copyright message / license.
  README                      Quick start instructions, for the impatient.
  RELEASE                     This file.
  TODO                        TODO notes.
  configure, Makefile.skel    sh and make scripts for building mips64emul
  doc                         Documentation.
  experiments                 Experimental code. (Usually not needed.)
  src, devices, and include   Source code.
  tests                       Regression tests.


To build the emulator, run the ./configure script, and then run make.

Building the emulator should work on most Unix-like systems. (One system which
is specifically known to NOT work is Ultrix/RISC inside the emulator; Ultrix
chokes on the configure script and the default cc in Ultrix doesn't work.)


Regarding files in the include/ directory:  only some of these are written by
me, the rest are from other sources (such as NetBSD). The license text says
that "All advertising materials mentioning features or use of this software"
must display acknowledgements. Even though I do NOT feel I mention features or
use of the header files (the "software") in any advertising materials, I am
still very grateful for the fact that these people have made their files
available for re-use, so regardless of legal requirements, I guess thanking
them like this is in order:
