Release notes for GXemul 0.3.X
==============================

Copyright (C) 2003-2005  Anders Gavare.


GXemul is a machine emulator, which can be used to experiment with binary code
for (among others) MIPS-based machines. Several emulation modes are available.
For some emulation modes, processors and surrounding hardware components are
emulated well enough to let unmodified operating systems run as if they were
running on a real machine.


The emulator can be used for many different things. One of the most interesting
uses is to run complete "guest" operating systems. I have verified that the
following operating systems can run inside the emulator:


       Guest operating system               Emulated machine
       ----------------------               ----------------

       NetBSD/pmax 2.0 (and 1.6.2)          DECstation 5000/200
       OpenBSD/pmax 2.8-BETA                DECstation 5000/200
       Ultrix 4.2-4.5                       DECstation 5000/200
       Sprite demo harddisk image           DECstation 5000/200
       Debian GNU/Linux for DECstation      DECstation 5000/200
       Redhat Linux 7.1 for mips            DECstation 5000/200
       NetBSD/arc 1.6.2                     Acer PICA-61
       OpenBSD/arc 2.3                      Acer PICA-61


A couple of other emulation modes exist (for SGI's MIPS-based machines,
Playstation 2, Cobalt, some other ARC machines, etc) but these modes are more
of a curiosity, and should not be considered working yet.

The emulator can also be used for other experiments; it does not have to 
run entire guest operating systems.


Summary of changes from version 0.3 to 0.3.X:

	x)  Changing the name from mips64emul to GXemul.

	x)  A fix which allows the i386 bintrans backend to compile with
	    GCC 2.x. (This is similar to the 0.2.4 -> 0.2.4.1 fix for GCC
	    2.x on Alpha.)

	x)  ...


This release has a number of known bugs, listed in the BUGS file, but feel
free to drop me an email regarding other bugs.


Files included in this release are:

  BUGS                        A list of known bugs.
  HISTORY                     Detailed revision history / changelog.
  LICENSE                     Copyright message / license.
  README                      Quick start instructions, for the impatient.
  RELEASE                     This file.
  TODO                        TODO notes.
  configure, Makefile.skel    sh and make scripts for building GXemul
  doc                         Documentation.
  experiments                 Experimental code. (Usually not needed.)
  src, devices, and include   Source code.
  tests                       Regression tests.


To build the emulator, run the ./configure script, and then run make.

Building the emulator should work on most Unix-like systems. (One system which
is specifically known to NOT work is Ultrix/RISC inside the emulator; Ultrix
chokes on the configure script and the default cc in Ultrix doesn't work.)


Regarding files in the include/ directory:  only some of these are written by
me, the rest are from other sources (such as NetBSD). The license text says
that "All advertising materials mentioning features or use of this software"
must display acknowledgements. Even though I do NOT feel I mention features or
use of the header files (the "software") in any advertising materials, I am
still very grateful for the fact that these people have made their files
available for re-use, so regardless of legal requirements, I guess thanking
them like this is in order:
