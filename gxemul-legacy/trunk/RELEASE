Currently working on what will become 0.4.6.

Release notes for Gavare's eXperimental Emulator (GXemul), 0.4.6
================================================================

Copyright (C) 2003-2007  Anders Gavare.


GXemul is an experimental instruction-level machine emulator. Several
emulation modes are available. In some modes, processors and surrounding
hardware components are emulated well enough to let unmodified operating
systems (e.g. NetBSD) run as if they were running on a real machine.

Processors (ARM, MIPS, PowerPC, and SuperH) are emulated using dynamic 
translation. Unlike some other dynamically translating emulators, GXemul 
does not need to generate native code, only a "runnable intermediate 
representation", and will thus run on any host architecture.

The documentation lists the machines and guest operating systems that can 
be regarded as "working" in GXemul. The best working guest operating 
systems are probably NetBSD/pmax and NetBSD/cats.


The changes between release 0.4.5.1 and 0.4.6 include, among other things:

    o)	NetBSD/pmppc can now run in the emulator (with root-on-nfs), on
	an emulated Artesyn PM/PPC board.

    o)	An instruction combination has been implemented for the idle loop
	used by NetBSD/arm (cats, netwinder, and iq80321). In plain English,
	this means that if the guest OS is now using any CPU, the emulator
	should not use much CPU on the host either.

    o)	Some minor SuperH emulation speed improvements.

    o)	General code cleanup: Non-working (skeleton) emulation modes have
	been removed, to make it easier to maintain the source code in
	the long run, and many unused/legacy constructs have been removed.

Please read the HISTORY file for more details.


Files included in this release are:

  HISTORY                     Detailed revision history / changelog.
  LICENSE                     Copyright message / license.
  README                      Quick start instructions, for the impatient.
  RELEASE                     This file.
  TODO                        TODO notes.
  configure, Makefile.skel    sh and make scripts for building GXemul.
  demos                       Tutorial-like demos of testmachine functionality.
  doc                         Documentation.
  experiments                 Experimental code. (Usually not needed.)
  src                         Source code.

To build the emulator, run the configure script, and then run make. This 
should work on most Unix-like systems.


Regarding files in the src/include/ directory: only some of these are written
by me, the rest are from other sources (such as NetBSD). The license text says
that "All advertising materials mentioning features or use of this software"
must display acknowledgements. Even though I do NOT feel I mention features or
use of the header files (the "software") in any advertising materials, I am
still very grateful for the fact that these people have made their files
available for re-use, so regardless of legal requirements, I guess thanking
them like this is in order:
