Version 0.1.1 of the emulator was released at 2004-07-02.  The next 
stable release will probably not happen very soon, as there are lots of 
things I'd like to experiment with that might make the code unstable.

I'll probably call the next release 0.2, since it will be different enough
from the 0.1 and 0.1.1 releases to warrant a big version increase.


Some of the things I'd like to do before a 0.2 release:

	x)  The configure script:
		o)  Only enable Alpha prefetch on pca56 or higher, not ev[45]
		o)  X11 libs and headers via command line option

	x)  TCP (in src/net.c) working satisfactory.

	x)  Linux should be possible to install as a guest OS.

	x)  SGI-IP[20,22,24] SCSI/dma stuff?

	x)  _Perhaps_ some bintrans stuff, if I have time. (Preferable for
	    Alpha, but i386 also.)

	x)  Documentation update.

	x)  Verify that the emulator configures, compiles, and runs on as
	    many host systems as possible, with as many guest OSes as possible.

Release notes for mips64emul 0.2
================================

Copyright (C) 2003-2004 by Anders Gavare  (md1gavan@mdstud.chalmers.se)


mips64emul is a MIPS machine emulator. The goals are to emulate 64-bit and
32-bit MIPS-like CPUs and enough surrounding hardware to fake real machines,
capable of running real (unmodified) operating systems, such as NetBSD, Linux,
or OpenBSD, and to assist in experimenting with MIPS-like code in general.
This is a spare time hobby project, and many things are not implemented yet.

and a configure + Makefile.skel combination for configuring and building the
emulator.

The following platforms and compilers have been used to build the emulator
at one time or another; not all of them have been tested for this specific
release, but will most probably work anyway.

Platforms/compilers that have been tried and did NOT work when they were 
tried are:

	HP-UX/hppa B.11.00
		using HP-UX' default cc   (gcc 3.3.2 works fine though)

	Ultrix/MIPS  (inside the emulator)
		chokes on the configure script, and
		the default cc does NOT work


Only a few files in the include/ directory are written by me, the rest are
from other sources (such as NetBSD).  The license text says that "All
advertising materials mentioning features or use of this software" must
display acknowledgements.  Even though I do NOT feel I mention features or
use of the header files (the "software") in any advertising materials, I am
still very greatful for the fact that these people have made their files
freely available, so I guess thanking them like this is in order:
