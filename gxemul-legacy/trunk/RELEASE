The release "road map" at the moment looks something like this:

  0.2.4 (or perhaps skip directly to 0.3, depending on what I have time
	 to implement)

Features I'd like to have time to implement:

	x)  more support for non-DECstation modes
	x)  stable bintrans for 64-bit CPUs (R4000 etc)
	x)  fix the Linux-related problems for good (How to do this?)


A 0.3 release would need to be tested a lot, to make sure that everything 
mentioned in the documentation works as stated. As many possible 
combinations as possible of the following must be tested:

	o)  host platforms
		x)  different architectures
		x)  host OSes
		x)  compilers (gcc vs other compilers)
	o)  different configure flags
	o)  different guest OSes
	o)  different runtime flags (eg. bintrans enabled or not)

	o)  no dead web links in the documentation

Release notes for mips64emul 0.2.4
==================================

Copyright (C) 2003-2004  Anders Gavare.


mips64emul is a free MIPS machine emulator. The goals are to emulate
MIPS-like CPUs and enough surrounding hardware to let unmodified operating
systems run as if they were running on a real machine, and to assist in
experiments involving MIPS-like code in general.

(MIPS is a registered trademark of MIPS Technologies. mips64emul is 
developed as a spare-time hobby, and there is no affiliation with MIPS 
Technologies in any way whatsoever.)


In its current form, it is possible to use the emulator to install an
operating systems onto a harddisk image; the "guest" operating system will run
similar to how it would run on a real physical machine.

The following guest operating systems have been verified to work:


    Operating system                   Emulated machine
    ----------------                   ----------------

    NetBSD 1.6.2/pmax                  DECstation 5000/200
    OpenBSD 2.8-BETA/pmax              DECstation 5000/200
    Ultrix 4.2-4.5/RISC                DECstation 5000/200
    Sprite demo harddisk image         DECstation 5000/200
    Debian GNU/Linux for DECstation    DECstation 5000/200 (*)
    Redhat Linux 7.1 for mips          DECstation 5000/200
    NetBSD 1.6.2/arc                   Acer PICA-61
    OpenBSD 2.3/arc                    Acer PICA-61


(*) = not very stable yet, but it "often" works.

A couple of other emulation modes exist (for SGI's MIPS-based machines,
Playstation 2, Cobalt, some other ARC machines, etc) but these modes are more
of a curiosity, and should not be considered working yet.


Here is a short summary of the changes from version 0.2.3 to 0.2.4:

	x)  Debian GNU/Linux can now be installed. However, it is VERY
	    unstable, and Linux Oopses when there is heavy serial console
	    output. A '-U' command line option reduces the risk, but doesn't
	    fix the problem.

	x)  When emulating framebuffers for machines like the DECstation
	    5000/200, that have a hardware mouse cursor, the host machine's
	    X cursor is now invisible. (This might not sound like a very
	    exiting change, but it "feels" a lot better than before.)

	x)  Improvements to the experimental dynamic binary translation
	    subsystem.

	x)  Many improvements to the single-step debugger.

	x)  Various other bugfixes and updates.


This release has a number of known bugs, listed in the BUGS file, but feel
free to drop me an email regarding other bugs.


Files included in this release are:

  BUGS                        A list of known bugs.
  HISTORY                     Detailed revision history / changelog.
  LICENSE                     Copyright message / license.
  README                      Quick start instructions, for the impatient.
  RELEASE                     This file.
  TODO                        TODO notes.
  doc                         Documentation.
  experiments                 Experimental code (not usually needed).
  src, devices, and include   Source code.
  tests                       Regression tests.


To build the emulator, run the ./configure script, and then run make.

Building the emulator should work on most Unix-like systems.  (One system
which is specifically known to NOT work is Ultrix/RISC inside the
emulator; Ultrix chokes on the configure script and the default cc in
Ultrix doesn't work.)


Regarding files in the include/ directory:  only some of these are
written by me, the rest are from other sources (such as NetBSD).  The
license text says that "All advertising materials mentioning features or
use of this software" must display acknowledgements.  Even though I do NOT
feel I mention features or use of the header files (the "software") in any
advertising materials, I am still very greatful for the fact that these
people have made their files available for re-use, so I guess thanking
them like this is in order:
