Release notes for Gavare's eXperimental Emulator (GXemul), 0.3.X
================================================================

Copyright (C) 2003-2005  Anders Gavare.


GXemul is an experimental instruction-level machine emulator. Several
emulation modes are available. In some modes, processors and surrounding
hardware components are emulated well enough to let unmodified operating
systems (e.g. NetBSD) run as if they were running on a real machine.

The processor architecture best emulated by GXemul is MIPS, but other
architectures are also partially emulated.

I have verified that the following "guest" operating systems can run inside
the emulator:

    Guest operating system             Emulated machine
    ----------------------             ----------------
    NetBSD/pmax 2.0.2 (and 1.6.2)      DECstation 5000/200
    OpenBSD/pmax 2.8-BETA              DECstation 5000/200
    Ultrix 4.2-4.5                     DECstation 5000/200
    Sprite demo harddisk image         DECstation 5000/200
    Debian GNU/Linux for DECstation    DECstation 5000/200
    Redhat Linux 7.1 for mips          DECstation 5000/200
    NetBSD/arc 1.6.2                   Acer PICA-61
    OpenBSD/arc 2.3                    Acer PICA-61
    NetBSD/hpcmips 2.0.2               NEC MobilePro 770, 780, 800, 880
    NetBSD/cobalt 2.0.2                Cobalt
    NetBSD/evbmips 2.0.2               Malta 5Kc/4Kc evaluation board
    NetBSD/sgimips 2.0.2               SGI O2 ("IP32")
    NetBSD/cats 2.0.2                  CATS (ARM)
    OpenBSD/cats 3.7                   CATS (ARM)

(Most of these are MIPS-based machines, except the CATS, which is an 
ARM-based machine.)

Some of these guest operating systems are easier to install and run than
others. The best supported mode is the DECstation 5000/200 emulation mode,
with NetBSD/pmax as the guest operating system.

A couple of other emulation modes exist. Some of these modes are almost
working well enough to run complete guest operating systems, but most are
just skeletons. The modes that work are listed in the documentation.

The emulator can also be used in other experiments; it does not have to run
entire guest operating systems. (However, GXemul does not simulate things
smaller than an instruction. What this means is that pipe-line stalls,
penalties caused by branch-prediction misses or cache misses, and other
micro-architectural effects are not simulated.)

The most imporant user-visible change between release 0.3.5 and 0.3.6 is:

   (X)  The experimental ARM emulation mode is now working well enough
        to install NetBSD/cats and OpenBSD/cats onto harddisk images.

There are two minor issues with the ARM emulation:

   1) A bug is triggered at the end of the OpenBSD/cats installation,
      so the MAKEDEV script must be run manually before booting for
      the first time.

   2) I have not had time to do any performance optimizations yet, so
      the ARM emulation mode is not very fast.

There have also been lots of other small changes, too small to mention here.

Files included in this release are:

  BUGS                        A list of known bugs.
  HISTORY                     Detailed revision history / changelog.
  LICENSE                     Copyright message / license.
  README                      Quick start instructions, for the impatient.
  RELEASE                     This file.
  TODO                        TODO notes.
  configure, Makefile.skel    sh and make scripts for building GXemul.
  doc                         Documentation.
  experiments                 Experimental code. (Usually not needed.)
  src                         Source code.

To build the emulator, run the ./configure script, and then run make.

Building the emulator should work on most Unix-like systems. (One system which
is specifically known to NOT work is Ultrix/RISC inside the emulator; Ultrix
chokes on the configure script and the default cc in Ultrix doesn't work.)

Regarding files in the src/include/ directory: only some of these are written
by me, the rest are from other sources (such as NetBSD). The license text says
that "All advertising materials mentioning features or use of this software"
must display acknowledgements. Even though I do NOT feel I mention features or
use of the header files (the "software") in any advertising materials, I am
still very grateful for the fact that these people have made their files
available for re-use, so regardless of legal requirements, I guess thanking
them like this is in order:
