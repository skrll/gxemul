Working on what will become 0.4.1.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release notes for Gavare's eXperimental Emulator (GXemul), 0.4.1
================================================================

Copyright (C) 2003-2006  Anders Gavare.


GXemul is an experimental instruction-level machine emulator. Several
emulation modes are available. In some modes, processors and surrounding
hardware components are emulated well enough to let unmodified operating
systems (e.g. NetBSD) run as if they were running on a real machine.

The documentation lists the machines and guest operating systems that can 
be regarded as "working" in GXemul. The best supported guest operating 
systems are probably NetBSD/pmax, NetBSD/cats, and OpenBSD/cats.


The most important changes between release 0.4.0.1 and 0.4.1 are:

    o)	MIPS emulation performance has been improved somewhat.

	(Among other things, after removing some buggy code (hints for
	physical page translations), the workaround for R2000/R3000 caches
	which was needed in 0.4.0.1 to make Linux and Ultrix run is not
	needed anymore.)

    o)	A new -s command line option is now available, for dumping
	runtime data/statistics on every instruction to a file.

	Currently, the following kinds of data can be dumped:

	1. the program counter (virtual address)
	2. the physical address representation of the program counter
	3. the internal dyntrans instruction call pointer (useful when
	   developing/optimizing the emulator)

	There was a -s command line option in previous releases of
	the emulator, but it did not work as intended, and was not
	rewritten for the dyntrans system.

Please read the HISTORY files for more details.


Files included in this release are:

  HISTORY                     Detailed revision history / changelog.
  LICENSE                     Copyright message / license.
  README                      Quick start instructions, for the impatient.
  RELEASE                     This file.
  TODO                        TODO notes.
  configure, Makefile.skel    sh and make scripts for building GXemul.
  demos                       Tutorial-like demos of testmachine functionality.
  doc                         Documentation.
  experiments                 Experimental code. (Usually not needed.)
  src                         Source code.

To build the emulator, run the configure script, and then run make. This 
should work on most Unix-like systems.


Regarding files in the src/include/ directory: only some of these are written
by me, the rest are from other sources (such as NetBSD). The license text says
that "All advertising materials mentioning features or use of this software"
must display acknowledgements. Even though I do NOT feel I mention features or
use of the header files (the "software") in any advertising materials, I am
still very grateful for the fact that these people have made their files
available for re-use, so regardless of legal requirements, I guess thanking
them like this is in order:
