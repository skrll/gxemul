	    =====================================================

	        THERE IS NO ACTUAL RELEASE OF mips64emul YET!

	    =====================================================


Only development snapshots of what I have in CVS.  However, I plan to make
a release some time in the future.

The following things have to work before a release to become a reality:

	o)  Diskimages need to be usable under at least some emulation modes,
	    preferably DECstations (the 'asc' SCSI controller), but others
	    would be nice as well,
		DONE: Partly. It needs to be fixed to work on more DECstation
		models, and with more OSes

	o)  it must be possible to install an entire operating system within
	    the emulator, and possibly even compile and run mips64emul
	    _inside_ the emulated environment,
		DONE: NetBSD/pmax and Ultrix 4.5 both seem to install
		without errors on the -D2 model.
		The emulator compiles just fine inside NetBSD/pmax, and
		runs (although very slowly).

	o)  regression tests  (yes, the skeleton is there, but it isn't used
	    yet),

	o)  the code needs to stabilize in general.

Then, to make the official release:

	o)  Try mips64emul on as many combinations as possible of the
	    following variables:

		x)  Host OS  (Linux, *BSD, Solaris, others?)
		x)  Host hardware (alpha, i386, mips :-), sparc, ...)
		x)  emulation mode   (DECstation, SGI?, ..)
		    and regression tests (if possible)
		x)  OSes running under emulation (NetBSD, OpenBSD,
		    Linux, Ultrix?, Irix?, ..)

	o)  Documentation.

	o)  Make sure all URLs on the project homepage and in the
	    documentation are valid.

	o)  General clean-up.
