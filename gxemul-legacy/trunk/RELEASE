Release notes for mips64emul 0.X
================================

Copyright (C) 2003-2004 by Anders Gavare  (md1gavan@mdstud.chalmers.se)


mips64emul is a MIPS machine emulator. The goals are to emulate MIPS-like CPUs
and enough surrounding hardware to fake real machines, capable of running real
(unmodified) operating systems, such as NetBSD, Linux, FreeBSD, or OpenBSD, and
to assist in experiments involving MIPS-like code in general.

This is a spare time hobby project, and many things are not implemented yet.

affiliated with MIPS Technologies in any way whatsoever.) 


TODO:  Major feature changes, 0.2 -> 0.X goes here.

and a configure + Makefile.skel combination for configuring and building the

Only a few files in the include/ directory are written by me, the rest are
from other sources (such as NetBSD).  The license text says that "All
advertising materials mentioning features or use of this software" must
display acknowledgements.  Even though I do NOT feel I mention features or
use of the header files (the "software") in any advertising materials, I am
still very greatful for the fact that these people have made their files
available for re-use, so I guess thanking them like this is in order:
