Release notes for mips64emul 0.X
================================

Copyright (C) 2003-2004 by Anders Gavare  (md1gavan@mdstud.chalmers.se)


mips64emul is a MIPS machine emulator. The goals are to emulate MIPS-like CPUs
and enough surrounding hardware to fake real machines, capable of running real
(unmodified) operating systems, such as NetBSD, Linux, FreeBSD, or OpenBSD, and
to assist in experiments involving MIPS-like code in general.

This is a spare time hobby project, and many things are not implemented yet.

(MIPS is a registered trademark of MIPS Technologies. This project is not
affiliated with MIPS Technologies in any way whatsoever.) 


TODO:  Major feature changes, 0.2 -> 0.X goes here.


This release has a number of known bugs, listed in the BUGS file, but feel
free to drop me an email regarding other bugs.


Files included in this release are:

  RELEASE            This file.

  README             Contains quick start instructions, for the impatient ones.

  LICENSE            Copyright message / license.

  HISTORY            Revision history/changelog.

  TODO               TODO notes.

  BUGS               A list of known bugs.

  src/, devices/,    Source code.
  and include/

  doc/               Documentation.

  tests/             Regression tests.

  experiments/       Experimental code (not needed by the emulator itself).

and a configure + Makefile.skel combination for configuring and building the
emulator.


Building the emulator should work on most Unix-like systems.  One system
which is specifically known to NOT work is Ultrix/RISC inside the
emulator; Ultrix chokes on the configure script and the default cc in
Ultrix doesn't work.


Regarding files in the include/ directory:  only a few of these are
written by me, the rest are from other sources (such as NetBSD).  The
license text says that "All advertising materials mentioning features or
use of this software" must display acknowledgements.  Even though I do NOT
feel I mention features or use of the header files (the "software") in any
advertising materials, I am still very greatful for the fact that these
people have made their files available for re-use, so I guess thanking
them like this is in order:

    California, Berkeley and its contributors.
