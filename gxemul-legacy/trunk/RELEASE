I'm working on what will become 0.3.8.

Release notes for Gavare's eXperimental Emulator (GXemul), 0.3.8
================================================================

Copyright (C) 2003-2006  Anders Gavare.


GXemul is an experimental instruction-level machine emulator. Several
emulation modes are available. In some modes, processors and surrounding
hardware components are emulated well enough to let unmodified operating
systems (e.g. NetBSD) run as if they were running on a real machine.

The documentation lists the machines and guest operating systems that can 
be regarded as "working" in GXemul. The best supported guest operating 
systems are probably NetBSD/pmax, NetBSD/cats, and OpenBSD/cats.

The user-visible changes between release 0.3.7 and 0.3.8 include:

    o)	The IQ80321 (Xscale) machine mode is now working well enough to
	allow NetBSD/evbarm 2.1 to run from a disk image.

    o)	Faster framebuffer output in some situations.

Source code related changes include:

    o)	I've finally begun to reimplement the MIPS emulation mode using the
	new dyntrans system. It will be quite some time until it can run
	anything, but things are moving in the right direction.

    o)	Some changes to the concepts of input-only, output-only, and
	input-output consoles.

    o)	Some more clean-up of PCI bus concepts.

    o)	Machine definitions have been moved out of src/machines.c, and into
	individual files in a new sub-directory (src/machines/).

There have also been lots of other changes, too many and small to mention here.

Files included in this release are:

  BUGS                        A list of known bugs.
  HISTORY                     Detailed revision history / changelog.
  LICENSE                     Copyright message / license.
  README                      Quick start instructions, for the impatient.
  RELEASE                     This file.
  TODO                        TODO notes.
  configure, Makefile.skel    sh and make scripts for building GXemul.
  doc                         Documentation.
  experiments                 Experimental code. (Usually not needed.)
  src                         Source code.

To build the emulator, run the ./configure script, and then run make. This 
should work on most Unix-like systems.

Regarding files in the src/include/ directory: only some of these are written
by me, the rest are from other sources (such as NetBSD). The license text says
that "All advertising materials mentioning features or use of this software"
must display acknowledgements. Even though I do NOT feel I mention features or
use of the header files (the "software") in any advertising materials, I am
still very grateful for the fact that these people have made their files
available for re-use, so regardless of legal requirements, I guess thanking
them like this is in order:
