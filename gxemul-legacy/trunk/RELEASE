I'm now working on post-0.2.4.1.

Some of the features I'd like to have time to implement:

	x)  better support for non-DECstation modes
		o)  for example, netbooting OpenBSD/sgi snapshots,
		    or work more on ARC modes (NetBSD/arc 2.0 scsi problems)
	x)  stable bintrans for 64-bit CPUs (R4000 etc)
		o)  everything that works without bintrans should work 
		    with bintrans
	x)  R4000 and R10000 caches (and hopefully working with bintrans)

Release notes for mips64emul 0.2.X
==================================

Copyright (C) 2003-2005  Anders Gavare.


mips64emul is a MIPS machine emulator. The goals are to emulate MIPS-like
processors and enough surrounding hardware to let unmodified operating systems
run as if they were running on a real machine, and to assist in experiments
involving MIPS-like code in general.

(MIPS is a registered trademark of MIPS Technologies. mips64emul is developed
as a spare-time hobby, and there is no affiliation with MIPS Technologies in
any way whatsoever.)


The emulator can be used for many different things. One of the most interesting
uses is to run complete "guest" operating systems. I have verified that the
following operating systems can run inside the emulator:


       Guest operating system               Emulated machine
       ----------------------               ----------------

       NetBSD/pmax 2.0 (and 1.6.2)          DECstation 5000/200
       OpenBSD/pmax 2.8-BETA                DECstation 5000/200
       Ultrix 4.2-4.5                       DECstation 5000/200
       Sprite demo harddisk image           DECstation 5000/200
       Debian GNU/Linux for DECstation      DECstation 5000/200
       Redhat Linux 7.1 for mips            DECstation 5000/200
       NetBSD/arc 1.6.2                     Acer PICA-61
       OpenBSD/arc 2.3                      Acer PICA-61


A couple of other emulation modes exist (for SGI's MIPS-based machines,
Playstation 2, Cobalt, some other ARC machines, etc) but these modes are more
of a curiosity, and should not be considered working yet.

Apart from running guest operating systems, the emulator can also be used for
other experiments with MIPS-like code.


Summary of changes from version 0.2.4.1 to 0.2.X:

	x)  In general, the code should be much cleaner than before.

	x)  Support for using "configuration files" has been added, instead
	    of entering all emulation parameters on the command line. This
	    has two advantages: shorter command lines, and the ability to
	    emulate multiple machines simulatenously.

	x)  Some seldomly used command line options have been changed or
	    removed, but 0.2.X should be mostly backward compatible with
	    0.2.4.1.

	x)  Many other bugfixes, too many to mention here.


This release has a number of known bugs, listed in the BUGS file, but feel
free to drop me an email regarding other bugs.


Files included in this release are:

  BUGS                        A list of known bugs.
  HISTORY                     Detailed revision history / changelog.
  LICENSE                     Copyright message / license.
  README                      Quick start instructions, for the impatient.
  RELEASE                     This file.
  TODO                        TODO notes.
  configure, Makefile.skel    sh and make scripts for building mips64emul
  doc                         Documentation.
  experiments                 Experimental code (not usually needed).
  src, devices, and include   Source code.
  tests                       Regression tests.


To build the emulator, run the ./configure script, and then run make.

Building the emulator should work on most Unix-like systems. (One system which
is specifically known to NOT work is Ultrix/RISC inside the emulator; Ultrix
chokes on the configure script and the default cc in Ultrix doesn't work.)


Regarding files in the include/ directory:  only some of these are written by
me, the rest are from other sources (such as NetBSD). The license text says
that "All advertising materials mentioning features or use of this software"
must display acknowledgements. Even though I do NOT feel I mention features or
use of the header files (the "software") in any advertising materials, I am
still very greatful for the fact that these people have made their files
available for re-use, so regardless of legal requirements, I guess thanking
them like this is in order:
