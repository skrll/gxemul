Release notes for mips64emul 0.2
================================

Copyright (C) 2003-2004 by Anders Gavare  (md1gavan@mdstud.chalmers.se)


mips64emul is a MIPS machine emulator. The goals are to emulate MIPS-like CPUs
and enough surrounding hardware to fake real machines, capable of running real
(unmodified) operating systems, such as NetBSD, Linux, or OpenBSD, and to
assist in experiments involving MIPS-like code in general.

This is a spare time hobby project, and many things are not implemented yet.

affiliated with MIPS Technologies in any way whatsoever.) 


Release 0.2 has a number of feature enhancements over 0.1 that are worth
mentioning. These are the major changes:

  o)  0.1 -> 0.1.1:

	x)  Added support for booting directly from disk images and CDROM
	    images (so far only for the DECstation emulation mode).

  o)  0.1.1 -> 0.2:

	x)  More "guest" operating systems now run to an acceptable degree in
	    the emulator; apart from NetBSD/pmax and Ultrix/RISC, it is now
	    also possible to run OpenBSD/pmax and Sprite for DECstation.

	x)  Clock devices in the emulated environment should now adjust
	    themselves to tick at approximately the same speed as the host's
	    clock. (This can be overridden with a command-line option, to set
	    a fixed emulation speed, regardless of the host's speed.)

	x)  Networking support (TCP/IP) is partly implemented, enough to
	    perform an install of NetBSD/pmax or OpenBSD/pmax via ftp or nfs.
	    (This should be considered experimental.)

	x)  The DECstation mouse pointer is now "de-accelerated" to attempt
	    to follow the host's mouse pointer.

	x)  Some minor performance enhancements.

Only a few files in the include/ directory are written by me, the rest are
from other sources (such as NetBSD).  The license text says that "All
advertising materials mentioning features or use of this software" must
display acknowledgements.  Even though I do NOT feel I mention features or
use of the header files (the "software") in any advertising materials, I am
still very greatful for the fact that these people have made their files
freely available, so I guess thanking them like this is in order:

    California, Berkeley and its contributors.
