Working on what will become 0.4.3.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release notes for Gavare's eXperimental Emulator (GXemul), 0.4.3
================================================================

Copyright (C) 2003-2006  Anders Gavare.


GXemul is an experimental instruction-level machine emulator. Several
emulation modes are available. In some modes, processors and surrounding
hardware components are emulated well enough to let unmodified operating
systems (e.g. NetBSD) run as if they were running on a real machine.

The documentation lists the machines and guest operating systems that can 
be regarded as "working" in GXemul. The best working guest operating 
systems are probably NetBSD/pmax, NetBSD/cats, and OpenBSD/cats.


Changes between release 0.4.2 and 0.4.3 include, among other things:

    o)	There is now a simple framework for letting emulated clocks, as
	seen by guest operating systems, run at the same speed as the
	host clock.

	So far, the DECstation, MobilePro, NetWinder, and CATS machine
	modes have been rewritten to use the new clock/timer framework.

    o)	The wdc (standard IDE controller) had a bug which prevented disk
	images larger than 2 GB to work correctly. This has been fixed.

    o)	The mouse cursor update routines in DECstation (LK201) emulation
	previously used the fact that guest OSes set the _hardware_
	cursor position. In order to support X Windows when emulating
	modern versions of NetBSD/pmax, which doesn't set the hardware
	position anymore, a workaround has been implemented which only
	sends relative coordinates to the guest OS. This has two drawbacks:

	1. Ultrix emulation with dual- and tripple-head emulation will
	   most likely feel very strange. It will still work, though.

	2. Cursor movement feels "accelerated", because the emulator
	   sends unaccelerated movements to the guest OS, which then
	   accelerates them. This can however be compensated to some
	   degree by running 'xset m 1 0' in the guest OS.

	Having weird accelerated mouse movement is better than having no
	mouse support at all, so this change was necessary.

Please read the HISTORY files for more details.


Files included in this release are:

  HISTORY                     Detailed revision history / changelog.
  LICENSE                     Copyright message / license.
  README                      Quick start instructions, for the impatient.
  RELEASE                     This file.
  TODO                        TODO notes.
  configure, Makefile.skel    sh and make scripts for building GXemul.
  demos                       Tutorial-like demos of testmachine functionality.
  doc                         Documentation.
  experiments                 Experimental code. (Usually not needed.)
  src                         Source code.

To build the emulator, run the configure script, and then run make. This 
should work on most Unix-like systems.


Regarding files in the src/include/ directory: only some of these are written
by me, the rest are from other sources (such as NetBSD). The license text says
that "All advertising materials mentioning features or use of this software"
must display acknowledgements. Even though I do NOT feel I mention features or
use of the header files (the "software") in any advertising materials, I am
still very grateful for the fact that these people have made their files
available for re-use, so regardless of legal requirements, I guess thanking
them like this is in order:
