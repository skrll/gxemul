Release notes for Gavare's eXperimental Emulator (GXemul), 0.3.X
================================================================

Copyright (C) 2003-2006  Anders Gavare.


GXemul is an experimental instruction-level machine emulator. Several
emulation modes are available. In some modes, processors and surrounding
hardware components are emulated well enough to let unmodified operating
systems (e.g. NetBSD) run as if they were running on a real machine.

MIPS processors are emulated using either a simple binary translation
layer ("recompilation"), which is used on Alpha and i386 hosts, or by
traditional interpretation (very very slow, but works on any host platform).

ARM and PowerPC processors are emulated using a newer dynamic translation
system. Performance is somewhere between traditional interpretation and
dynamic recompilation; however, the dynamic translation system used in
GXemul does NOT require platform-specific back-end code. In plain English,
this means that the dyntrans system works on any host platform.

I have verified that the following "guest" operating systems can run inside
the emulator. Instructions on how to install and run these can be found in
the documentation.

    Guest operating system             Emulated machine
    ----------------------             ----------------
    NetBSD/pmax 3.0 (and 1.6.2)        DECstation 5000/200
    OpenBSD/pmax 2.8-BETA              DECstation 5000/200
    Ultrix 4.2-4.5                     DECstation 5000/200
    Sprite demo harddisk image         DECstation 5000/200
    Debian GNU/Linux for DECstation    DECstation 5000/200
    Redhat Linux 7.1 for mips          DECstation 5000/200
    NetBSD/arc 1.6.2                   Acer PICA-61
    NetBSD/hpcmips 3.0                 NEC MobilePro 770, 780, 800, 880
    NetBSD/cobalt 2.1                  Cobalt
    NetBSD/evbmips 2.1                 Malta 5Kc/4Kc evaluation board
    NetBSD/sgimips 2.1                 SGI O2 ("IP32")
    NetBSD/cats 3.0                    CATS (ARM)
    OpenBSD/cats 3.8                   CATS (ARM)
    NetBSD/prep 2.1                    PReP (PowerPC Reference Platform)

Some of these guest operating systems are easier to install and run than
others. The best supported guest operating systems are probably NetBSD/pmax,
NetBSD/cats and OpenBSD/cats.

The emulator can also be used in other experiments; it does not have to run
entire guest operating systems. However, as GXemul is an instruction-level
emulator, it does not simulate things smaller than an instruction. What this
means is that pipe-line stalls, penalties caused by branch-prediction misses
or cache misses, and other micro-architectural effects are not simulated.

User-visible change between release 0.3.7 and 0.3.X include:

    o)	...

There have also been lots of other changes, too many and small to mention here.

Files included in this release are:

  BUGS                        A list of known bugs.
  HISTORY                     Detailed revision history / changelog.
  LICENSE                     Copyright message / license.
  README                      Quick start instructions, for the impatient.
  RELEASE                     This file.
  TODO                        TODO notes.
  configure, Makefile.skel    sh and make scripts for building GXemul.
  doc                         Documentation.
  experiments                 Experimental code. (Usually not needed.)
  src                         Source code.

To build the emulator, run the ./configure script, and then run make.

Building the emulator should work on most Unix-like systems. (One system which
is specifically known to NOT work is Ultrix/RISC inside the emulator; Ultrix
chokes on the configure script and the default cc in Ultrix doesn't work.)

Regarding files in the src/include/ directory: only some of these are written
by me, the rest are from other sources (such as NetBSD). The license text says
that "All advertising materials mentioning features or use of this software"
must display acknowledgements. Even though I do NOT feel I mention features or
use of the header files (the "software") in any advertising materials, I am
still very grateful for the fact that these people have made their files
available for re-use, so regardless of legal requirements, I guess thanking
them like this is in order:
