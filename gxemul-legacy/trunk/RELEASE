Working on what will become 0.4.4.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release notes for Gavare's eXperimental Emulator (GXemul), 0.4.4
================================================================

Copyright (C) 2003-2007  Anders Gavare.


GXemul is an experimental instruction-level machine emulator. Several
emulation modes are available. In some modes, processors and surrounding
hardware components are emulated well enough to let unmodified operating
systems (e.g. NetBSD) run as if they were running on a real machine.

Processors (ARM, MIPS, PowerPC, SuperH) are emulated using dynamic 
translation. Unlike some other dynamically translating emulators, GXemul 
does not need to generate native code, only a "runnable intermediate 
representation", and will thus run on any host architecture.

The documentation lists the machines and guest operating systems that can 
be regarded as "working" in GXemul. The best working guest operating 
systems are probably NetBSD/pmax and NetBSD/cats.


Changes between release 0.4.3 and 0.4.4 include, among other things:

    o)	The interrupt subsystem has been redesigned. This means two things:

	  x)  Internal code cleanup, which makes the whole emulator more
	      maintainable. Instead of using magically encoded integers
	      for interrupts, strings are now used. These strings are in
	      the form of "paths", so that devices and busses can more
	      easily be connected to other busses, devices, or CPUs.

	  x)  Some machine types which happened to work in release 0.4.3,
	      but were not listed in the documentation as working, may
	      have stopped working now. As always, the documentation should
	      indicate the combinations of machine modes and guest OSes that
	      are supposed to work.

    o)	SuperH (SH4) emulation is now somewhat more stable, enough to let a
	NetBSD/dreamcast Live CD be usable.

    o)	PowerPC "G4" emulation is now stable enough to let NetBSD/macppc
	run from a disk image. (Installing actually worked before, but the
	NetBSD/macppc GENERIC kernel uses AltiVec instructions which were
	not implemented before.)

    o)	The PICA-61 (arc) and i80321 (evbarm) emulation modes now have their
	timers fixed at 100 Hz. A hardcoded speed like this is very ugly, but
	it is at least better than before (when the timer wasn't really
	running at any specific speed at all).

Please read the HISTORY files for more details.


Files included in this release are:

  HISTORY                     Detailed revision history / changelog.
  LICENSE                     Copyright message / license.
  README                      Quick start instructions, for the impatient.
  RELEASE                     This file.
  TODO                        TODO notes.
  configure, Makefile.skel    sh and make scripts for building GXemul.
  demos                       Tutorial-like demos of testmachine functionality.
  doc                         Documentation.
  experiments                 Experimental code. (Usually not needed.)
  src                         Source code.

To build the emulator, run the configure script, and then run make. This 
should work on most Unix-like systems.


Regarding files in the src/include/ directory: only some of these are written
by me, the rest are from other sources (such as NetBSD). The license text says
that "All advertising materials mentioning features or use of this software"
must display acknowledgements. Even though I do NOT feel I mention features or
use of the header files (the "software") in any advertising materials, I am
still very grateful for the fact that these people have made their files
available for re-use, so regardless of legal requirements, I guess thanking
them like this is in order:
