Currently working on what will become 0.4.5.1, which is 0.4.5 + some
SuperH updates to allow OpenBSD/landisk to run).

Release notes for Gavare's eXperimental Emulator (GXemul), 0.4.5.1
==================================================================

Copyright (C) 2003-2007  Anders Gavare.


GXemul is an experimental instruction-level machine emulator. Several
emulation modes are available. In some modes, processors and surrounding
hardware components are emulated well enough to let unmodified operating
systems (e.g. NetBSD) run as if they were running on a real machine.

Processors (ARM, MIPS, PowerPC, SuperH) are emulated using dynamic 
translation. Unlike some other dynamically translating emulators, GXemul 
does not need to generate native code, only a "runnable intermediate 
representation", and will thus run on any host architecture.

The documentation lists the machines and guest operating systems that can 
be regarded as "working" in GXemul. The best working guest operating 
systems are probably NetBSD/pmax and NetBSD/cats.


The changes between release 0.4.4.1 and 0.4.5 include, among other things:

    o)	Initial support for "disk overlays" has been implemented. This
	enables e.g. simple roll-back of emulated disk contents to a
	previous state.

    o)	Dyntrans bug fixes; code translations on physical addresses that
	were offset a multiple of 128 MB from each other could either
	cause weird bugs, or translation leaks (leading to unnecessary
	dyntrans cache overflows).

    o)	Some cleanup: The GDB debugging stub support, some dummy machine
	modes (TS7200, Walnut, PB1000, and Meshcube), and some dummy or
	experimental CPUs (RCA180x and Transputer) have been removed, to
	make the emulator slightly more maintainable.

The change between release 0.4.5 and 0.4.5.1 is:

    o)	OpenBSD/landisk 4.1 can be installed and run from a disk image.

	(This is the result of some SuperH emulation fixes, and a temporary
	workaround/hack to allow OpenBSD/landisk to boot. The hack needs
	to be removed once the real bug has been found.)

  TODO                        TODO notes.
  configure, Makefile.skel    sh and make scripts for building GXemul.
  demos                       Tutorial-like demos of testmachine functionality.
  doc                         Documentation.
  experiments                 Experimental code. (Usually not needed.)

To build the emulator, run the configure script, and then run make. This 
should work on most Unix-like systems.


Regarding files in the src/include/ directory: only some of these are written
by me, the rest are from other sources (such as NetBSD). The license text says
that "All advertising materials mentioning features or use of this software"
must display acknowledgements. Even though I do NOT feel I mention features or
use of the header files (the "software") in any advertising materials, I am
still very grateful for the fact that these people have made their files
available for re-use, so regardless of legal requirements, I guess thanking
them like this is in order:
