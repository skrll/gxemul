Serious bugs:

  x)  An unknown math coprocessor bug. (Ultrix' dxclock sometimes looks
      weird.)

  x)  Enabling cache emulation (./configure --enable-caches) triggers bugs.

  x)  Linux/DECstation (Debian) oopses extremely often unless -U is used
      at run-time. I'm not sure yet why it bugs out. With -U, the risk is
      lower, but not completely gone. _Maybe_ this is a bug in Linux. Why?
      Because the oops message contains things like ANSI escape codes and
      characters in registers (including the pc and return address register);
      this looks like a buffer overflow in the serial driver. (Another thing
      that gives weight to this theory is that the serial driver in Linux is
      still being developed.)  But this is just a guess.

  x)  bintrans bugs.  (For example, NetBSD/sgimips for IP22/24 hangs during
      boot with bintrans enabled.)


Less serious bugs / issues:

  o)  hardware device ticks are done at cycle specific intervals, not
      instruction intervals, so sometimes a fraction of a cycle can be
      "lost".

  o)  running Linux/DECstation 2.4.26 with no scsi disks attached causes
      a warning message to be printed by Linux.

  o)  UDP packets that are too large are not handled well by the Lance device.

  o)  Colors in X11 framebuffers on MacOS X hosts are wrong. (I'm not sure
      how to solve this; the code works on both little-endian (Alpha) and
      big-endian (UltraSPARC) X-servers...)

  o)  bintranslated 64-bit stuff checks to see if the top 32 bits are
      all zeroes or all ones, and then uses 32-bit tables and such. This
      is a bug. It should check the top 33 bits, not 32. (Alpha only, already
      fixed for i386?)

  o)  NetBSD/arc 2.0 uses the ASC controller in a way which GXemul cannot yet
      handle. (NetBSD 1.6.2 works ok.)
