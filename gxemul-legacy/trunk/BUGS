Please report any bugs you find to me.  Here is a list of KNOWN bugs:

  o)  PMAG-BA / BT459 issues (for example when running DECstation "-D2 -X"
      emulation):

	x)  NetBSD/pmax works with X with -CR3000, but not always with
	    -CR4000.  Reason and solution unknown at this point.
            Temporary workaround:  Don't use -CR4000 if you want to run
            X11 inside emulated NetBSD/pmax.

        x)  The mouse pointer is just a block, sometimes leaves crap at
            the edge of the screen, and some other minor issues.
