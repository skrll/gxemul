Please report any bugs you find to me.  Here is a list of KNOWN bugs.  (Also,
anything listed in TODO is not worth reporting.)


Serious bugs:

  x)  NetBSD/pmax in the emulator sometimes crashes when running X. It is very
      uncommon with -CR3000, a bit more common with -CR4000. Reason and
      solution are unknown at this point.

  x)  Linux/DECstation (Debian) installer (boot.img) crashes during install.
      This might be a bug in Linux, according to
      http://www.debian.org/ports/mips/:
	"R3000 Decstation does crash with current cvs kernel"

  x)  Newer NetBSD 2.0_BETA snapshots from releng.netbsd.org crash when run
      on a Linux/i386 host. A 20040606 snapshot runs fine, but a 20040626
      snapshot doesn't. (On an Alpha host, both run fine.)  (This bug is
      probably caused by overwritten memory, or some similar type of bug.)

Less serious bugs / issues:

  o)  the ssnop instruction doesn't align on a cycle boundary

  o)  hardware device ticks are done at cycle specific intervals, not
      instruction intervals, so sometimes a fraction of a cycle can be
      "lost".

  o)  running Linux/DECstation 2.4.26 with no scsi disks attached causes
      a warning message to be printed by Linux.

  o)  UDP packets that are too large are not handled well by the Lance
      device.
