Please report any bugs you find to me.  Here is a list of KNOWN bugs.  (Also,
anything listed in TODO is not worth reporting.)


Serious bugs:

  x)  NetBSD/pmax in the emulator sometimes crashes when running X. It is very
      uncommon with -CR3000, a bit more common with -CR4000. Reason and
      solution are unknown at this point.

  x)  Linux/DECstation (Debian) installer (boot.img) crashes during install.

  x)  Newer NetBSD 2.0_BETA snapshots from releng.netbsd.org sometimes crash.
          Host\Snapshot:       20040606 20040707
            Linux/i386:        ok       crash
            FreeBSD/Alpha:     ok       ok
            OpenBSD/sparc64:   ok       ok
      crash = core dump when doing malloc(), so maybe some memory control
      blocks are overwritten by some code.

Less serious bugs / issues:

  o)  the ssnop instruction doesn't align on a cycle boundary

  o)  hardware device ticks are done at cycle specific intervals, not
      instruction intervals, so sometimes a fraction of a cycle can be
      "lost".

  o)  running Linux/DECstation 2.4.26 with no scsi disks attached causes
      a warning message to be printed by Linux.

  o)  UDP packets that are too large are not handled well by the Lance
      device.
