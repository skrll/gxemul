Please report any bugs you find to me.  Here is a list of KNOWN bugs:

  o)  PMAG-BA / BT459 issues (for example when running DECstation "-D2 -X"
      emulation):

	x)  NetBSD/pmax works with X with -CR3000, but not always with -CR4000.
	    Reason and solution unknown at this point. A temporary workaround
	    is to not use -CR4000 if you want to run X11 inside emulated
	    NetBSD/pmax.

        x)  The mouse pointer is a rectangular shape with no transparency, so
	    it looks a bit funny.
