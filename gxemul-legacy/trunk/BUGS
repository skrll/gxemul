If you encounter any bugs not listed here, and not listed in the TODO, 
then feel free to report them to me.


Serious bugs:

  x)  NetBSD/pmax in the emulator sometimes crashes when running X. It is very
      uncommon with -CR3000, a bit more common with -CR4000. Reason and
      solution are unknown at this point.   (Update: Hm. This description is
      very vague.)

  x)  An unknown math coprocessor bug. (Ultrix' dxclock sometimes looks
      weird.)

  x)  Linux/DECstation (Debian) oopses extremely often unless -U is used
      at run-time. I'm not sure yet why it bugs out. With -U, the risk is
      lower, but not completely gone. _Maybe_ this is a bug in Linux. Why?
      Because the oops message contains things like ANSI escape codes and
      characters in registers (including the pc and return address register);
      this looks like a buffer overflow in the serial driver. (Another thing
      that gives weight to this theory is that the serial driver in Linux is
      still being developed.)  But this is just a guess.

  x)  bintrans bugs.  (For example, NetBSD/sgimips for IP22/24 hangs during
      boot with bintrans enabled.)


Less serious bugs / issues:

  o)  building on Debian/Alpha seems to run into the same problems as
      on my FreeBSD/Alpha box earlier (which was the reason for a 0.2.4.1
      release).

  o)  the ssnop instruction doesn't align on a cycle boundary

  o)  hardware device ticks are done at cycle specific intervals, not
      instruction intervals, so sometimes a fraction of a cycle can be
      "lost".

  o)  running Linux/DECstation 2.4.26 with no scsi disks attached causes
      a warning message to be printed by Linux.

  o)  UDP packets that are too large are not handled well by the Lance
      device.

  o)  Colors in X11 framebuffers on MacOS X hosts are wrong. (I'm not sure
      how to solve this; the code works on both little-endian (Alpha) and
      big-endian (UltraSPARC) X-servers...)

  o)  bintranslated 64-bit stuff checks to see if the top 32 bits are
      all zeroes or all ones, and then uses 32-bit tables and such. This
      is a bug. It should check the top 33 bits, not 32.

  o)  NetBSD/arc 2.0 uses the ASC controller in a way which mips64emul
      cannot yet handle. (NetBSD 1.6.2 works ok.)
