KNOWN BUGS IN RELEASE 0.4.0
---------------------------

Because the MIPS emulation mode has been completely rewritten, and I
haven't had much time to debug it, there are some known (serious) bugs:

	o)  Although the new MIPS emulation system is stable enough to
	    let many guest operating systems install, it is not stable
	    enough to let the emulator be compiled inside itself (in a
	    guest OS) after an install, in all emulation modes.

	o)  Ultrix 4.5 on R3000 in the emulator has problems with keyboard
	    interrupts; Ultrix 4.2 works fine, though, and Ultrix 4.5 when
	    run with -C R4400.

These problems will hopefully be corrected in future releases.
