Please report any bugs you find to me.  Here is a list of KNOWN bugs:

  o)  X11 framebuffer support for bit-depths other than 24-bit and 8-bit
      displays has _NOT_ been implemented yet.

  o)  PMAG-BA / BT459 issues (for example when running DECstation "-D2 -X"
      emulation):
	x)  NetBSD/pmax works with X with -CR3000, but not with -CR4000.
            Reason and solution unknown at this point.

        x)  Different versions of Ultrix behave differently in repect to the
            vertical retrace interrupts from the BT459.  I haven't been able
            to write a single version of the interrupt mechanism which works
            with all versions.
