  x)  Floating point coprocessor stuff is buggy. Writing a new (portable)
      framework for fp emulation is in the TODO.

  x)  Linux/DECstation (Debian) oopses extremely often unless -U is used at
      run-time. I'm not sure yet why it bugs out. With -U, the risk is lower,
      but not completely gone. _Maybe_ this is a bug in Linux. Why? Because the
      oops message contains things like ANSI escape codes and characters in
      registers (including the pc and return address register); this looks like
      a buffer overflow in the serial driver. (Another thing that gives weight
      to this theory is that the serial driver in Linux is still being
      developed.)  But this is just a guess.

  x)  Hardware device ticks are done at cycle specific intervals, not
      instruction intervals, so sometimes a fraction of a cycle can be "lost".

  x)  Binary-translated 64-bit stuff checks to see if the top 32 bits are
      all zeroes or all ones, and then uses 32-bit tables and such. This
      is a bug. It should check the top 33 bits, not 32. (Alpha only, already
      fixed for i386?)

  x)  NetBSD/arc 2.0 uses the ASC controller in a way which GXemul cannot yet
      handle. (NetBSD 1.6.2 works ok.) (Possibly a problem in NetBSD itself,
      http://mail-index.netbsd.org/source-changes/2005/11/06/0024.html suggests
      that.)
