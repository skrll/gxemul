Please report any bugs you find to me.  Here is a list of KNOWN bugs.  (Also,
anything listed in TODO is not worth reporting.)


Serious bugs:

  x)  NetBSD/pmax works with X with -CR3000, but not always with -CR4000.
      Reason and solution unknown at this point. A temporary workaround
      is to not use -CR4000 if you want to run X11 inside emulated
      NetBSD/pmax.

  x)  Sprite runs fine on a Linux host, but not on an Alpha host.

  x)  The mouse pointer is a rectangular shape with no transparency, so
	    it looks a bit funny.

  x)  The emulator doesn't hide the host's mouse cursor yet.


Less serious bugs / issues:

  o)  the ssnop instruction doesn't align on a cycle boundary

  o)  hardware device ticks are done at cycle specific intervals, not
      instruction intervals, so sometimes a fraction of a cycle can be
      "lost".

  o)  running Linux/DECstation 2.4.26 with no scsi disks attached causes
      a warning message to be printed by Linux.

  o)  UDP packets that are too large are not handled well by the Lance
      device.
