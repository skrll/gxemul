--------------------------------------------

Some things, in totally random order, that I'd like to fix:
(Some items in this list are probably out-to-date by now.)

Dyntrans:
	x)  Instruction combination collisions? How to avoid easily...
	x)  Think about how to do both SHmedia and SHcompact in a reasonable
	    way! (Or AMD64 long/protected/real, for that matter.)
	x)  68K emulation; think about how to do variable instruction
	    lengths across page boundaries.
	x)  Dyntrans with valgrind-inspired memory checker. (In memory_rw,
	    it would be reasonably simple to add; in each individual fast
	    load/store routine = a lot more work, and it would become
	    kludgy very fast.)
	x)  Dyntrans with SMP... lots of work to be done here.
	x)  Dyntrans with cache emulation... lots of work here as well.
	x)  Remove the concept of base RAM completely; it would be more
	    generic to allow RAM devices to be used "anywhere".
	o)  dev_mp doesn't work well with dyntrans yet
	o)  In general, IPIs, CAS, LL/SC etc must be made to work with dyntrans
	x)  Redesign/rethink the delay slot mechanism used for e.g. MIPS,
		so that it caches a translation (that is, an instruction
		word and the instr_call it was translated to the last
		time), so that it doesn't need to do slow
		to_be_translated for each end of page?
	x)  Program Counter statistics:
		Per machine? What about SMP? All data to the same file?
		A debugger command should be possible to use to enable/
		disable statistics gathering.
		Configuration file option!
	x)  Breakpoints:
		o) Physical vs virtual addresses!
		o) 32-bit vs 64-bit sign extension for MIPS, and others?
	x)  INVALIDATION should cause translations in _all_ cpus to be
	    invalidated, e.g. on a write to a write-protected page
	    (containing code)
	x)  16-bit encodings? (MIPS16, ARM Thumb, 32-bit SH on SH64)
	x)  Lots of other stuff: see src/cpus/README_DYNTRANS
	x)  Native code generation backends:
		o)  think carefully about this.
		o)  simple syntax for emitting opcodes; backend implementation
		    must be optional, so I don't have to write more code
		    than necessary. after all, the non-native (C) code should
		    always work.
		o)  convert into native code only after an entire
			block has been translated? probably best.
		o)  the "almost native" opcodes may be rearranged,
		    "peep-hole optimized", etc. and then as a separate step
		    this list of almost native opcodes is written out
		    as native code.
		o)  think about delay slots at the end of a block!
		o)  x86/amd64 code generator can be very similar... perhaps
		o)  NOTE that generation is per _ABI_, not per host arch!
		    the configure script must detect ABI!!!
		o)  branches to already translated code blocks can
			link the blocks together
		o)  load/store are the most important to optimize

Simple Valgrind-like checks?
	o)  Mark every address with bits which tell whether or not the address
	    has been written to.
	o)  What should happen when programs are loaded?  Text/data, bss (zero
	    filled). But stack space and heap is uninitialized.
	o)  Uninitialized local variables:
		A load from a place on the stack which has not previously
		been stored to => warning. Increasing the stack pointer using
		any available means should reset the memory to uninitialized.
	o)  If calls to malloc() and free() can be intercepted:
		o)  Access to a memory area after free() => warning.
		o)  Memory returned by malloc() is marked as not-initialized.
		o)  Non-passive, but good to have: Change the argument
		    given to malloc, to return a slightly larger memory
		    area, i.e.  margin_before + size + margin_after,
		    and return the pointer  + margin_before.
		    Any access to the margin_before or _after space results
		    in warnings. (free() must be modified to free the
		    actually allocated address.)

MIPS:
	o)  Nicer MIPS status bits in register dumps.
	o)  Alignment exceptions.
	o)  Floating point exception correctness.
	o)  Fix this? Triggered by NetBSD/sgimips? Hm:
		to_be_translated(): TODO: unimplemented instruction:
		000000000065102c: 00200800 (d)  rot_00  at,zr,0
	o)  Some more work on opcodes.
		x) MIPS64 revision 2.
			o)  Find out which actual CPUs implement the rev2 ISA!
			o)  DROTR32 and similar MIPS64 rev 2 instructions,
			    which have a rotation bit which differs from
			    previous ISAs.
			o)  EI and DI instructions for MIPS64/32 rev 2.
			    NOTE: These are _NOT_ the same as for R5900!
		x) _MAYBE_ TX79 and R5900 actually differ in their
		   opcodes? Check this carefully!
	o)  Dyntrans: Count register updates are probably not 100% correct yet.
	o)  Refactor code for performance and readability/maintainability.
	o)  (Re)implement 128-bit loads/stores for R5900.
	o)  R4000 and others:
		x)  watchhi/watchlo exceptions, and other exception
		    handling details
	o)  R10000 and others:  (R12000, R14000 ?)
		x)  The code before the line
			/*  reg[COP0_PAGEMASK] = cpu->cd.mips.coproc[0]->tlbs[0].mask & PAGEMASK_MASK;  */
		    in cpu_mips.c is not correct for R10000 according to
		    Lemote's Godson patches for GXemul. TODO: Go through all
		    register definitions according to http://techpubs.sgi.com/library/tpl/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi/hdwr/bks/SGI_Developer/books/R10K_UM/sgi_html/t5.Ver.2.0.book_263.html#HEADING334
		    and make sure everything works with R10000.
		    Then test with OpenBSD/sgi?
		x)  Entry LO mask (as above).
		x)  memory space, exceptions, ...
		x)  use cop0 framemask for tlb lookups
		    (http://techpubs.sgi.com/library/tpl/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi/hdwr/bks/SGI_Developer/books/R10K_UM/sgi_html/t5.Ver.2.0.book_284.html)

SuperH:
	x)  SH4 performance is VERY low when running user-space instructions,
	    because I actually simulate the 4-entry ITLB as being separate
	    from the 64-entry DTLB. This is correct, but VERY slow. I need
	    to experiment with _not_ simulating it in too much detail.
	x)  SH4 interrupt controller:
		x)  MASKING should be possible!
	x)  SH4 DMA (0xffa00000)
	x)  SH4 UBC (0xff200000)
	x)  Store queues can copy 32 bytes at a time, there's no need to
	    copy individual 32-bit words. (Performance improvement.)
	x)  SH4 BSC (Bus State Controller)
	x)  Instruction tracing should include symbols for branch targets,
	    and so on, to make the output more human readable.
	x)  SH3-specific devices: Pretty much everything!
	x)  NetBSD/evbsh3, mmeye, hpcsh! Linux?
	x)  Replace pc-relative loads with immediate load, if within the
	    same page. (Similar to the same optimization for ARM.)
	x)  Floating point speed!
	x)  Floating point exception correctness.
	x)  NetBSD HEAD (as of April 2007) hangs during bootup, because it
	    turns on/off interrupts in an unfortunately synchronized way
	    with dyntrans. This needs to be fixed.
	x)  Exceptions for unaligned load/stores. OpenBSD/landisk uses
	    this mechanism for its reboot code (machine_reset).
	x)  Think carefully about how to implement SH5/SH64 (for evbsh5).

Landisk SH4:
	x)  When NetBSD/landisk 4.0 has been released, make sure it works
	    in the emulator. (Update documentation, etc.)

Dreamcast:
	x)  G2 DMA
	x)  LAN adapter (dev_mb8696x.c).  NetBSD root-on-nfs.
	x)  PVR:  Lots of stuff. See dev_pvr.c.
	x)  Better GDROM support
	x)  Modem
	x)  PCI bridge/bus?
	x)  Maple bus:
		x)  Correct controller input
		x)  Mouse input
	x)  Software emulation of BIOS calls:
		x)  GD-ROM emulation: Use the GDROM device.
		x)  Use the VGA font as a fake ROM font. (Better than
		    nothing.)
	x)  Make as many as possible of the KOS examples run!
	x)  More homebrew demos/games.
	x)  SPU: Sound emulation (ARM cpu).
	x)  VME processor emulation? "(Sanyo LC8670 "Potato")" according to
	    Wikipedia, LC86K87 according to Comstedt's page. See
	    http://www.maushammer.com/vmu.html for a good description of
	    the differences between LC86104C and the one used in the VME.

Alpha:
	x)  OSF1 PALcode, Virtual memory support.
	x)  PALcode replacement! PAL1E etc opcodes...?
	x)  Interrupt/exception/trap handling.
	x)  Floating point exception correctness.
	x)  More work on bootup memory and register contents.
	x)  More Alpha machine types, so it could work with
	    OpenBSD, FreeBSD, and Linux too?

SPARC (both the ISA and the machines):
	o)  Implement Adress space identifiers; load/stores etc.
	o)  Exception/trap/interrupt handling.
	o)  Save/restore register windows etc! Both v9 and pre-v9!
	o)  Finish the subcc and addcc flag computation code.
	o)  Add more registers (floating point, control regs etc)
	o)  Disassemly of some more instructions?
	o)  Are sll etc 32-bit sign-extending or zero-extending?
	o)  Floating point exception correctness.
	o)  SPARC v8, v7 etc?
	o)  More machine modes and devices.

Debugger:
	o)  How does SMP debugging work? Does it simply use "threads"?
		What if the guest OS (running on an emulated SMP machine)
		has a usertask running, with userland threads?
	o)  Try to make the debugger more modular and, if possible, reentrant!
	o)  Remove the emul command? (But show network info if showing
		machines?)
	o)  Evaluate expressions within []? That would allow stuff like
		cpu[x] where x is an expression.
	o)  Settings:
		x)  Special handlers for Write!
			+)  MIPS coproc regs
			+)  Alpha/MIPS/SPARC zero registers
			+)  x86 64/32/16-bit registers
		x)  Value formatter for resulting output.
	o)  see src/debugger.c for more

POWER/PowerPC:
	x)  Fix DECR timer speed, so it matches the host.
	x)  NetBSD/prep 3.x triggers a possible bug in the emulator:
	    <wdc_exec_command(0xd005e514,0xd60cdd30,0,8,..)>
	      <ata_get_xfer(0,0xd60cdd30,0,8,..)>
	        <0x26c550(&ata_xfer_pool,2,0,8,..)>
	        <0x35c71c(0x3f27000,0,52,8,..)>
	      <ata_exec_xfer(0xd005e4c8,0x3f27000,0,13,..)>
	        <atastart(0xd005e4c8,0x3f27000,0,13,..)>
	          <__wdccommand_start(0xd005e4c8,0x3f27000,0,13,..)>
	            <bsw1(&prep_isa_io_space_tag,0x800001f6,0,176,..)>
		[ wdc: write to SDH: 0xb0 (sectorsize 2, lba=1, drive 1, head 0) ]
	            <wdcwait(0xd005e4c8,72,64,0xbb8,..)>
	              <0x198120(0xd005e4c8,72,64,0xbb8,..)>
	                <bsr1(&prep_isa_io_space_tag,0,0,0xbb8,..)>
	                <delay(100,0,0,0xbb8,..)>
	    Note: <bsr1(&prep_isa_io_space_tag,0,0,0xbb8,..)>
	x)  PPC optimizations; instr combs
	x)  64-bit stuff: either Linux on G5, or perhaps some hobbyist
		version of AIX? (if there exists such a thing)
	x)  macppc: adb controller; keyboard (for framebuffer mode)
	x)  make OpenBSD/macppc work (PCI controller stuff)
	x)  Floating point exception correctness.
	x)  Alignment exceptions.

PReP:
	x)  Clock time! ("Bad battery blah blah")

Algor:
	o)  Other models than the P5064?
	o)  PCI interrupts... needed for stuff like the tlp NIC?

BeBox:
	o)  Interrupts. There seems to be a problem with WDC interrupts
	    "after a short while", although a few interrupts get through?
	o)  Perhaps find a copy of BeOS and try it?

HPCmips:
	x)  Mouse/pad support! :)
	x)  A NIC? (As a PCMCIA device?)

M88K:
	o)  Everything. :)
		o)  More instruction disassembly!
		o)  Implement more instructions.
		o)  has-delay-slot (for debugging)
		o)  Find manuals!
		o)  MMU stuff
		o)  Exceptions
		o)  FPU
		o)  Control registers

AVR:
	o)  Everything.

ARM:
	o)  See netwinder_reset() in NetBSD; the current "an internal error
	    occured" message after reboot/halt is too ugly.
	o)  ARM "wait"-like instruction?
	o)  try to get netbsd/evbarm 3.x or 4.x running (iq80321)
	o)  make the xscale counter registers (ccnt) work
	o)  make the ata controller usable for FreeBSD!
	o)  Zaurus emulation:
		x)  OpenBSD/zaurus
		x)  NetBSD/zaurus? See the following URL:
		    http://mail-index.netbsd.org/port-arm/2006/11/19/0000.html
	o)  Debian/cats crashes because of unimplemented coproc stuff.
	    fix this?

Test machines:
	o)  dev_fb block fill and copy
	o)  dev_fb draw characters (from the built-in font)?
	o)  dev_fb input device? mouse pointer coordinates and buttons
		(allow changes in these to cause interrupts as well?)
	o)  Redefine the halt() function so that it stops "sometimes
	    soon", i.e. usage in demo code should be:
		for (;;) {
			halt();
		}

Better CD Image file support:
	x)  Support CD formats that contain more than 1 track, e.g.
	    CDI files (?). These can then contain a mixture of e.g. sound
	    and data tracks, and booting from an ISO filesystem path
	    would boot from [by default] the first data track.
	    (This would make sense for e.g. Dreamcast CD images, or
	    possibly other live-CD formats.)

Networking:
	x)  Redesign of the networking subsystem, at least the NAT translation
		part. The current way of allowing raw ethernet frames to be
		transfered to/from the emulator via UDP should probably be
		extended to allow the frames to be transmitted other ways as
		well.
	x)  Also adding support for connecting ttys (either to xterms, or to
		pipes/sockets etc, or even to PPP->NAT or SLIP->NAT :-).
	x)  Documentation updates (!) are very important, making it easier to
		use the (already existing) network emulation features.
	x)  Fix performance problems caused by only allowing a
	    single TCP packet to be unacked.
	x)  Don't hardcode offsets into packets!
	x)  Test with lower than 100 max tcp/udp connections,
	    to make sure that reuse works!
	x)  Make OpenBSD work better as a guest OS!
	x)  DHCP? Debian doesn't actually send DHCP packets, even
		though it claims to? So it is hard to test.
	x)  Multiple networks per emulation, and let different
	    NICs in machines connect to different networks.
	x)  Support VDE (vde.sf.net)? Easiest/cleanest (before a
	    redesign of the network framework has been done) is
	    probably to connect it using the current (udp) solution.
	x)  Allow SLIP connections, possibly PPP, in addition to
	    ethernet?

Cache simulation:
	o)  Command line flags for:
		o)  CPU endianness?
		o)  Cache sizes? (multiple levels)
	o)  Separate from the CPU concept, so that multi-core CPUs sharing
	    e.g. a L2 cache can be simulated (?)
	o)  Instruction cache emulation is easiest (if separate from the
	    data cache); similar hack as the S;I; hack in cpu_dyntrans.c.
	    NOTE: if the architecture has a delay slot, then an instruction
	    slot can actually be executed as 2 instructions.
	o)  Data cache emulation = harder; each arch's load/store routines
	    must include support? running one instruction at a time and
	    having a cpu-dependant lookup function for each instruction
	    is another option (easier to implement, but very very slow).

Documentation:
	x)  Note about sandboxing/security:
		Not all emulated instructions fail in the way they would
		do on real hardware (e.g. a userspace program writing to
		a system register might work in GXemul, but it would
		fail on real hardware).  Sandbox = contain from the
		host OS. But the emulated programs will run "less
		securely".
	x)  Try NetBSD/arc 4.x! (It seems to work with disk images!)
	x)  NetBSD/pmax 4 install instructions: xterm instead of vt100!
	x)  BETTER DEVICE EXAMPLES!
		o)  Move away from technical.html to somewhere new.
		o)  DEVICE_TICK
		o)  Implement example devices using interrupts, dyntrans
		    memory access, etc.?
	x)  Document the dyntrans core?
	x)  Rewrite the section about experimental devices, after the
	    framebuffer acceleration has been implemented, and demos
	    written. (Symbolic names instead of numbers; example
	    use cases, etc. Mention demo files that use the various
	    features?)
	x)  "a very simple linear framebuffer device (for graphics output)"
	    under "which machines does gxemul emulate" ==> better
	    description?
	x)  Better description on how to set up a cross compiler?
	    Example for MIPS64.
	o)  Automagic documentation generation?
		x)  machines, cpus, devices.
		x)  REMEMBER that several machines/devices can be in
			the same source file!
	o)  Try to rewrite the install instructions for those machines
	    that use 3MAX into using CATS or hpcmips? (To remove the need
	    to use a raw ffs partition, using up all of the disk image.)

More generic out_of_memory error reporting, and check everywhere!
	Causes:	OpenBSD has low default limits for normal users.
		Host is 32-bit? (32-bit hosts are limited to 4 GB or less
		of userspace memory.)
		You are actually low on RAM. (As trivial as this might sound,
		Unix systems usually allow processes to allocate virtual
		memory beyond the amount of RAM in the machine.)

The Device subsystem:
	x)  allow devices to be moved and/or changed in size (down to a
	    minimum size, etc, or up to a max size); if there is a collision,
	    return false. It is up to the caller to handle this situation!
	x)  NOTE: Translations must be invalidated, both for
	    registering new devices, and for moving existing ones.
	    cpu->invalidate translation caches, for all CPUs that
	    are connected to a specific memory.
	x)  keep track of interrupts and busses? actually, allowing any device
	    to be a bus might be a nice idea.
	x)  turn interrupt controllers into devices? :-)
	x)  refactor various clocks/nvram/cmos into one device?

PCI:
	x)  Pretty much everything related to runtime configuration, device
	    slots, interrupts, etc must be redesigned/cleaned up. The current
	    code is very hardcoded and ugly.
	o)  Allow cards to be added/removed during runtime more easily.
	o)  Allow cards to be enabled/disabled (i/o ports, etc, like
	    NetBSD needs for disk controller detection).
	o)  Allow devices to be moved in memory during runtime.
	o)  Interrupts per PCI slot, etc. (A-D).
	o)  PCI interrupt controller logic... very hard to get right,
	    because these differ a lot from one machine to the next.
	x)  last write was ffffffff ==> fix this, it should be used
	    together with a mask to get the correct bits. also, not ALL
	    bits are size bits! (lowest 4 vs lowest 2?)
	x)  add support for address fixups
	x)  generalize the interrupt routing stuff (lines etc)

Clocks and timers:
	x)  Fix the PowerPC DECR interrupt speed! (MacPPC and PReP speed, etc.)
	x)  DON'T HARDCODE 100 HZ IN cpu_mips_coproc.c!
	x)  Test the 8253? Right now it doesn't seem to be used?
	x)  NetWinder timeofday is incorrect!
	x)  Cobalt TOD is incorrect!
	x)  Go through all other machines, one by one, and fix them.

Config file parser:
	o)  Rewrite it from scratch!
	o)  Usage of any expression available through the debugger
	o)  Allow interrupt controllers to be added! and interrupts
	    to be used in more ways than before
	o)  Support for running debugger commands (like the -c
	    command line option)

Floating point layer:
	o)  make it common enough to be used by _all_ emulation modes
	o)  implement correct error/exception handling and rounding modes
	o)  implement more helper functions (i.e. add, sub, mul...)
	o)  non-IEEE modes (i.e. x86)?

Userland emulation:
	x)  Dynamic linking!
	x)  Lots of stuff; freebsd, netbsd, linux, ... syscalls.
	x)  Initial register/stack contents (environment, command line args).
	x)  Return value (from main).
	x)  mmap emulation layer
	x)  errno emulation layer
	x)  struct conversions for may syscalls

Sound:
	x)  generic sound framework
	x)  add one or more sound cards as devices; add a testmachine
	    sound card first?
	x)  Dreamcast sound? Generic PCI sound cards?

ASC SCSI controller:
	x)  NetBSD/arc 2.0 uses the ASC controller in a way which GXemul
	    cannot yet handle. (NetBSD 1.6.2 works ok.) (Possibly a problem
	    in NetBSD itself, http://mail-index.netbsd.org/source-changes/
	    2005/11/06/0024.html suggests that.)
	    NetBSD 4.x seems to work? :)

Caches / memory hierarchies: (this is mostly MIPS-specific)
	o)  src/memory*.c: Implement correct cache emulation for
	    all CPU types. (currently only R2000/R3000 is implemented)
	    (per CPU, multiple levels should be possible, associativity etc!)
	o)  R2000/R3000 isn't _100%_ correct, just almost correct :)
	o)  Move the -S (fill mem with random) functionality into the
	    memory.c subsystem, not machine.c or wherever it is now
	o)  ECC stuff, simulation of memory errors?  (Machine dependent)
	o)  More than 4GB of emulated RAM, when run on a 32-bit host?
	    (using manual swap-out of blocks to disk, ugly)
	o)  A global command line option should be used to turn
	    cache emulation on or off. When off, caches should be
	    faked like they are right now. When on, caches and
	    memory latencies should be emulated as correctly as
	    possible.

File/disk/symbol handling:
	o)  Make sure that disks can be added/removed during runtime!
	    (Perhaps this needs a reasonably large re-write.)
	o)  Remove some of the complexity in file format guessing, for
		Ultrix kernels that are actually disk images?
	o)  Better handling of tape files	
	o)  Read function argument count and types from binaries? (ELF?)
	o)  Better demangling of C++ names. Note: GNU's C++ differs from e.g.
	    Microsoft's C++, so multiple schemes must be possible. See
	    URL at top of src/symbol_demangle.c for more info.

Userland ABI emulation:
	o)  see src/useremul.c

Better framebuffer and X-windows functionality:
	o)  Generalize the update_x1y1x2y2 stuff to an extend-region()
	    function...
	o)  -Yx sometimes causes crashes.
	o)  Simple device access to framebuffer_blockcopyfill() etc,
	    and text output (using the built-in fonts), for dev_fb.
	o)  CLEAN UP the ugly event code
	o)  Mouse clicks can be "missed" in the current system; this is
	    not good. They should be put on a stack of some kind.
	o)  More 2D and 3D framebuffer acceleration.
	o)  Non-resizable windows?  Or choose scaledown depending
		on size (and center the image, with a black border).
	o)  Different scaledown on different windows?
	o)  Non-integral scale-up? (E.g. 640x480 -> 1024x768)
	o)  Switch scaledown during runtime? (Ala CTRL-ALT-plus/minus)
	o)  Bug reported by Elijah Rutschman on MacOS with weird
	    keys (F5 = cursor down?).
	o)  Keyboard and mouse events:
		x)  Do this for more machines than just DECstation
		x)  more X11 cursor keycodes
		x)  Keys like CTRL, ALT, SHIFT do not get through
		    by themselves (these are necessary for example
		    to change the font of an xterm in X in the
		    emulator)
	o)  Generalize the framebuffer stuff by moving _ALL_ X11
		specific code to src/x11.c!
