How to add new machine types to GXemul:
---------------------------------------

The easiest way is to simply copy an existing machine (e.g. machine_zaurus.c)
into whatever you want the new machine to be called (machine_foo.c), update
Makefile.skel to include machine_foo.o in the list of object files to build,
and then change the contents of machine_foo.c.

A machine_*.c file may contain more than one machine specification (e.g.
machine_test.c contains several "bare" and "test" machines), but usually it is
best to think of these files as containing one machine per file.
