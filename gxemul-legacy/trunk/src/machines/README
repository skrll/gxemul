How to add new machine types to GXemul:
---------------------------------------

The easiest way is to simply copy a test machine (such as machine_testppc.c)
into whatever you want the new machine to be called, e.g. machine_foo.c,
update Makefile.skel to include machine_foo.o in the list of object files to
build, and then change the contents of machine_foo.c.
