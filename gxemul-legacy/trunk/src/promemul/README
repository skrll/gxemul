(P)ROM emulation in GXemul:
---------------------------

The general philosophy that applies to PROM emulation is that no raw 
(binary) dumps of real ROMs should be included in GXemul. It is nicer to 
emulate in software only those parts of a machine's ROM or BIOS or 
whatever that is actually necessary to boot an operating system.

This directory contains software emulation of various PROM and BIOS 
interfaces.
