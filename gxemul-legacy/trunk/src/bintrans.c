 *
 *  Dynamic binary translation.
 *
 *
 *
 *  NOTE:  This file is basically a test are for ideas, and a
 *         place to write down comments.
 *
 *
 *	Keep a cache of a certain number of blocks.
 *
 *	Simple basic-block stuff. Only simple-enough instructions are
 *		translated. (for example, the 'cache' and 'tlbwr' instructions
 *		are NOT simple enough)
 *
 *	Translate code in physical ram, not virtual.
 *		Why?  This will keep things translated over process
 *		switches, and TLB updates.
 *
 *	Do not translate over MIPS page boundaries (4 KB).  (Perhaps translation
 *		over page boundaries can be allowed in kernel space...?)
 *
 *	If memory is overwritten, any translated block for that page must
 *		be invalidated.
 *
 *	Check before running a basic block that no external
 *		exceptions will occur for the duration of the
 *		block, and count down so that we can run for as
 *		long as possible in bintrans mode.
 *		(External = from a hardware device.)
 *
 *	Check for exceptions inside the block, for those instructions
 *		that require that.  Update the instruction counter by
 *		the number of successfully executed instructions only.
 *
 *	Don't do dynamic register allocation:
 *		For alpha, manipulate the cpu struct for "uncommon"
 *			registers, store common registers in alpha
 *			registers and write back at end. (TODO:
 *			experiments must reveal which registers are
 *			common and which aren't.)
 *		For i386, manipulate the cpu struct directly.
 *
 *	Multiple target archs (alpha, i386, sparc, mips :-), ...)
 *		Try to use arch specific optimizations, such as prefetch
 *		on alphas that support that.
 *		Not all instructions will be easily translated to all
 *		backends.
 *
 *	How to do loads/stores?
 *		Caches of some kind, or hard-coded at translation time?
 *		Hard-coded would mean that a translation is valid as
 *		long as the TLB entries that that translation entry
 *		depends on aren't modified.
 *
 *	Testing:  Running regression tests with and without the binary
 *		translator enabled should obviously result in the exact
 *		same results, or something is wrong.
 *
 *	JUMPS:  Blocks need to be glued together efficiently.
 *
 *
 *  The general idea would be something like this:
 *  A block of code in the host's memory would have to conform with
 *  the C function calling ABI on that platform, so that the code block
 *  can be called easily from C. That is, entry and exit code needs to
 *  be added, in addition to the translated instructions.
 *
 *	o)  Check for the current PC in the translation cache.
 *
 *	o)  If the current PC is not found, then make a decision
 *		regarding making a translation attempt, or not.
 *		Fallback to normal instruction execution in cpu.c.
 *
 *	o)  If there is a code block for the current PC in the
 *		translation cache, do a couple of checks and then
 *		run the block. Update registers and other values
 *		as neccessary.
 *
 *  The checks would include:
 *	don't start running inside a delay slot or "likely" slot.
 *	nr of cycles until the next hardware interrupt occurs
