dev_*:
	Devices. (Please read 'Emulation of hardware devices' in
	doc/technical.html for more information about these.)

	Example: dev_wdc, the IDE/ATA[PI] harddisk controller.

pci_*:
	PCI devices. These are not necessarily normal devices, but rather
	"glue code" which identifies devices as PCI devices.

	Example: pci_ali_m1543, contains glue for ali_m1532 and ali_m5229,
	the first being a PCI-ISA bridge, and the second an IDE controller.
	(The m5229 uses the dev_wdc device.)

bus_*:
	Bus framework.
