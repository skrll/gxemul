dev_*:
	Devices. (Please read 'Emulation of hardware devices' in
	doc/technical.html for more information about these.)

	Example: dev_wdc, the IDE/ATA[PI] harddisk controller.

bus_pci.c:
	PCI bus framework, and some glue code for PCI devices.
	Example of glue code would be PCI-IDE controllers, which are
	implemented using dev_wdc plus some PCI configuration registers,
	which identifies the specific controller (fake, but it works).

other files:
	Misc. stuff.
