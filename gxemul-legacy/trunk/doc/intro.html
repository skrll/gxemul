<p><br>
<a name="overview"></a>
<h3>Overview:</h3>

GXemul is an instruction-level machine emulator, which can be used to
experiment with binary code for (among others) MIPS-based machines.
Several emulation modes are available. For some emulation modes,
processors and surrounding hardware components are emulated well enough to
let unmodified operating systems run as if they were running on a real
machine.

<p>Devices and CPUs are not simulated with 100% accuracy. They are only
``faked'' well enough to make operating systems (e.g. NetBSD) run without
complaining too much. Still, the emulator could be of interest for
academic research and experiments, such as when learning how to write
operating system code.

<p>The emulator is written in C, does not depend on external libraries
(except X11, but that is optional), and should compile and run on most
Unix-like systems. If it doesn't, then that is a bug. (You do not need any
MIPS compiler toolchain to build or use GXemul. If you need to compile
MIPS binaries from sources, then of course you need such a toolchain, but
that is completely separate from GXemul.)

<p>The emulator contains code which tries to emulate the workings of CPUs
and surrounding hardware found in real machines, but it does not contain
any ROM code. You will need some form of program (in binary form) to run
in the emulator. For many emulation modes, PROM calls are handled by the
emulator itself, so you do not need to use any ROM image at all.

<p>You can use pre-compiled kernels (for example NetBSD kernels, or
Linux), or other programs that are in binary format, and in some cases
even actual ROM images. A couple of different file formats are supported
(ELF, a.out, ECOFF, SREC, and raw binaries).

<p>If you do not have a kernel as a separate file, but you have a bootable
disk image, then it is sometimes possible to boot directly from that
image. (This works for example with DECstation emulation, or when booting
from ISO9660 CDROM images.)








<p><br>
<a name="free"></a>
<h3>Is GXemul Free software?</h3>

Yes. I have released GXemul under a Free license. The code in GXemul is
Copyrighted software, it is <i>not</i> public domain. (If this is
confusing to you, you might want to read up on the definitions of the
four freedoms associated with Free software, <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html</a>.)

<p>
The code I have written is released under a 3-clause BSD-style license
(or "revised BSD-style" if one wants to use
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/bsd.html">GNU jargon</a>).
Apart from the code I have written, some files are copied from other sources
such as NetBSD, for example header files containing symbolic names of
bitfields in device registers. They are also covered by similar licenses,
but with some additional clauses. If you plan to redistribute GXemul
(for example as a binary package), or reuse code from GXemul,
then you should check those files for their license terms.

<p>
(The licenses usually require that the original Copyright and license 
terms are included when you make a copy or modification. The "easiest way 
out" if you plan to redistribute code from GXemul is to simply supply 
the source code. You should however check individual files for details.)





<p><br>
<a name="build"></a>
<h3>How to compile/build the emulator:</h3>

Uncompress the .tar.gz distribution file, and run
<pre>
	$ <b>./configure</b>
	$ <b>make</b>
</pre>

<p>
This should work on most Unix-like systems. If it doesn't, then
mail me a bug report.

<p>
(Note for Windows users: there is a possibility that some releases 
and/or snapshots will also work with Cygwin, but I can't promise that.)

<p>
The emulator's performance is highly dependent on both runtime settings
and on compiler settings, so you might want to experiment with different
CC and CFLAGS environment variable values. For example, on a modern PC, 
you could try the following:
<p>
<pre>
        $ <b>CFLAGS="-mcpu=pentium4 -O3" ./configure</b>
        $ <b>make</b>
</pre>

<p>
Run <b><tt>./configure --help</tt></b> to get a list of configure options. (The 
possible options differ between different releases and snapshots.)






<p><br>
<a name="run"></a>
<h3>How to run the emulator:</h3>

Once you have built GXemul, running it should be rather straight-forward.
Running <tt><b>gxemul</b></tt> without arguments (or with the
<b><tt>-h</tt></b> or <b><tt>-H</tt></b> command line options) will
display a help message.

<p>
To get some ideas about what is possible to run in the emulator, please 
read the section about <a href="guestoses.html">installing "guest" 
operating systems</a>. If you are interested in using the emulator to 
develop code on your own, then you should also read the section about
<a href="experiments.html#hello">Hello World</a>.

<p>
To exit the emulator, type CTRL-C to enter the 
single-step debugger, and then type <tt><b>quit</b></tt>.

<p>
If you are starting an emulation by entering settings directly on the 
command line, and you are not using the <tt><b>-x</b></tt> option, then all 
terminal input and output will go to the main controlling terminal.
CTRL-C is used to break into the debugger, so in order to send CTRL-C to 
the running (emulated) program, you may use CTRL-B.
(This should be a reasonable compromise to allow the emulator to be usable
even on systems without X Windows.)

<p>
There is no way to send an actual CTRL-B to the emulated program, when
typing in the main controlling terminal window. The solution is to either
use <a href="configfiles.html">configuration files</a>, or use
<tt><b>-x</b></tt>. Both these solutions cause new xterms to be opened for 
each emulated serial port that is written to. CTRL-B and CTRL-C both have 
their original meaning in those xterm windows.





<p><br>
<a name="cpus"></a>
<h3>Which CPU types does GXemul emulate?</h3>

<h4>MIPS:</h4>

Emulation of R4000, which is a 64-bit CPU, was my initial goal.
R2000/R3000-like CPUs (32-bit), R1x000, and generic MIPS32/MIPS64-style
CPUs are also emulated, and are hopefully almost as stable as the R4000 
emulation.

<p>
I have written an experimental dynamic binary translation subsystem.
This gives higher total performance than interpreting one instruction at a
time and executing it. (If you wish to enable bintrans, add <b>-b</b> to
the command line, but keep in mind that it is still experimental.)


<h4>URISC:</h4>

I have implemented an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URISC">URISC</a>
emulation mode, just for fun. The only instruction available in an URISC
machine is "reverse subtract and skip on borrow". (It is probably not
worth trying to do bintrans with URISC, because any reasonable URISC
program relies on self-modifying code, which is bad for bintrans
performance.)


<h4>POWER/PowerPC</h4>

There is some code for 64-bit (and 32-bit) POWER/PowerPC emulation, enough
to run "Hello World", but not enough to run complete operating systems.  
This mode isn't really working yet.


<h4>Other CPU types:</h4>

Some other CPU architectures (such as x86) can also be partially emulated.
These are not enabled by default though, because of their unstable-ness.





<p><br>
<a name="accuracy"></a>
<h3>Emulation accuracy:</h3>

GXemul is an instruction-level emulator; things that would happen in
several steps within a real CPU are not taken into account (eg. pipe-line
stalls or out-of-order execution). Still, instruction-level accuracy seems
to be enough to be able to run complete guest operating systems inside the
emulator.

<p>
Caches are by default not emulated. In some cases, the existance of caches
is "faked" to let operating systems think that they are there. (There is
some old code for R2000/R3000 caches, but it has probably suffered from
bitrot by now.)

<p>
The emulator is <i>not</i> timing-accurate. It can be run in a 
"deterministic" mode, <tt><b>-D</b></tt>. The meaning of deterministic is 
simply that running two emulations with the same settings will result in 
identical runs. Obviously, this requires that no user interaction is 
taking place, and that clock speeds are fixed with the <tt><b>-I</b></tt> 
option. (Deterministic in this case does <i>not</i> mean that the emulation
will be identical to some actual real-world machine.)





<p><br>
<a name="emulmodes"></a>
<h3>Which machines does GXemul emulate?</h3>

A few different machine types are emulated. The following machine types 
are emulated well enough to run at least one "guest OS":

<p>
<ul>
  <li><b>DECstation 5000/200</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;("3max")
	<br>Serial controller (including keyboard and mouse), ethernet,
	SCSI, and graphical framebuffers.
  <p>
  <li><b>Acer Pica-61</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;(an ARC machine)
	<br>Serial controller, "VGA" text console, and SCSI.
  <p>
  <li><b>NEC MobilePro 770, 780, 800, and 880</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;(HPCmips machines)
	<br>Framebuffer, keyboard, and a PCMCIA IDE controller.
  <p>
  <li><b>Cobalt</b>
	<br>Serial controller and PCI IDE.
</ul>

<p>
There is code in GXemul for emulation of many other machine types;
the degree to which these work range from "almost" being able to run
a complete OS, to almost completely unsupported (perhaps just enough
support to output a few boot messages via serial console).

<p>
In addition to emulating real machines, there is also a "test-machine".
A test-machine consists of one or more CPUs and a few experimental 
devices such as:

<p>
<ul>
  <li>a console I/O device (putchar() and getchar()...)
  <li>an inter-processor communication device, for SMP experiments
  <li>a very simple linear framebuffer device (for graphics output)
</ul>

<p>
This mode is useful if you wish to run experimental code, but do not
wish to target any specific real-world machine type, for example for
educational purposes.

<p>
You can read more about these experimental devices
<a href="experiments.html#expdevices">here</a>.







<p><br>
<a name="guestos"></a>
<h3>Which guest OSes are possible to run?</h3>

This table lists the guest OSes that run well enough to be considered
working in the emulator. They can boot from a harddisk image and be
interacted with similar to a real machine.

<p><br>

<super>*</super> Although Linux runs under DECstation emulation, the
default 2.4.27 kernel in Debian GNU/Linux does not support keyboards on
the 5000/200 (the specific DECstation model being emulated), so when the
login prompt is reached you cannot interact with the system. Kaj-Michael
Lang has compiled and made available a newer kernel from the current
mips-linux development tree. You can find it here: <a
href="http://home.tal.org/~milang/o2/kernels/">http://home.tal.org/~milang/o2/kernels</a>/<a
href="http://home.tal.org/~milang/o2/kernels/vmlinux-2.4.29-rc2-r3k-mipsel-decstation">vmlinux-2.4.29-rc2-r3k-mipsel-decstation</a>
This newer kernel supports keyboard input, but it does not have Debian's
ethernet patches, so you will not be able to use keyboard/framebuffer
<i>and</i> networking at the same time.
