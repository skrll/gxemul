<a name="overview"></a>
<h3>Overview:</h3>

GXemul is an experimental instruction-level machine emulator. Several
emulation modes are available. In some modes, processors and surrounding
hardware components are emulated well enough to let unmodified operating
systems (e.g. NetBSD) run as if they were running on a real machine.

<p>Devices and processors (ARM, MIPS, PowerPC) are not simulated with 100% 
accuracy. They are only ``faked'' well enough to allow guest operating 
systems run without complaining too much. Still, the emulator could be of 
interest for academic research and experiments, such as when learning how 
to write operating system code.

<p>The emulator is written in C, does not depend on third-party libraries,
and should compile and run on most 64-bit and 32-bit Unix-like systems.

<p>The emulator contains code which tries to emulate the workings of CPUs
and surrounding hardware found in real machines, but it does not contain
any ROM code. You will need some form of program (in binary form) to run
in the emulator. For many emulation modes, PROM calls are handled by the
emulator itself, so you do not need to use any ROM image at all.

<p>You can use pre-compiled kernels (for example NetBSD kernels, or
Linux), or other programs that are in binary format, and in some cases
even actual ROM images. A couple of different file formats are supported
(ELF, a.out, ECOFF, SREC, and raw binaries).

<p>If you do not have a kernel as a separate file, but you have a bootable
disk image, then it is sometimes possible to boot directly from that
image. (This works for example with DECstation emulation, or when booting
from ISO9660 CDROM images.)

Mallett, Juan Romero Pardines, Alec Voropay, Göran Weinholt, Alexander 
Yurchenko, and everyone else who has provided me with feedback.







<p><br>
<a name="free"></a>
<h3>Is GXemul Free software?</h3>

Yes. I have released GXemul under a Free license. The code in GXemul is
Copyrighted software, it is <i>not</i> public domain. (If this is
confusing to you, you might want to read up on the definitions of the
four freedoms associated with Free software, <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html</a>.)

<p>The code I have written is released under a 3-clause BSD-style license
(or "revised BSD-style" if one wants to use <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/bsd.html">GNU jargon</a>). Apart from
the code I have written, some files are copied from other sources such as
NetBSD, for example header files containing symbolic names of bitfields in
device registers. They are also covered by similar licenses, but with some
additional clauses. The main point, however, is that the licenses require
that the original Copyright and license terms are included when you make a
copy or modification.

<p>If you plan to redistribute GXemul <i>without</i> supplying the source
code, then you need to comply with each individual source file some other
way, for example by writing additional documentation containing copyright
notes. I have not done this, since I do not plan on making distributions
without source code. You need to check all individual files for details.
The "easiest way out" if you plan to redistribute code from GXemul is, of
course, to let it remain open source and simply supply the source code.

<p>In case you want to reuse parts of GXemul, but you need to do that 
under a different license (e.g. the GPL), then contact me and I might 
re-license/dual-license files on a case-by-case basis.





<p><br>
<a name="build"></a>
<h3>How to compile/build the emulator:</h3>

Uncompress the .tar.gz distribution file, and run
<pre>
	$ <b>./configure</b>
	$ <b>make</b>
</pre>

<p>This should work on most Unix-like systems. GXemul does not require any 
specific libraries to build, however, if you build on a system which does 
not have X11 libraries installed, some functionality will be lost.

<p>The emulator's performance is highly dependent on both runtime settings
and on compiler settings, so you might want to experiment with different
CC and CFLAGS environment variable values. For example, on an AMD Athlon
host, you might want to try setting <tt>CFLAGS</tt> to <tt>-march=athlon</tt>
before running <tt>configure</tt>.







<p><br>
<a name="run"></a>
<h3>How to run the emulator:</h3>

Once you have built GXemul, running it should be rather straight-forward.
Running <tt><b>gxemul</b></tt> without arguments (or with the
<b><tt>-h</tt></b> or <b><tt>-H</tt></b> command line options) will
display a help message.

<p>
To get some ideas about what is possible to run in the emulator, please 
read the section about <a href="guestoses.html">installing "guest" 
operating systems</a>. If you are interested in using the emulator to 
develop code on your own, then you should also read the section about
<a href="experiments.html#hello">Hello World</a>.

<p>
To exit the emulator, type CTRL-C to enter the 
single-step debugger, and then type <tt><b>quit</b></tt>.

<p>
If you are starting an emulation by entering settings directly on the 
command line, and you are not using the <tt><b>-x</b></tt> option, then all 
terminal input and output will go to the main controlling terminal.
CTRL-C is used to break into the debugger, so in order to send CTRL-C to 
the running (emulated) program, you may use CTRL-B.
(This should be a reasonable compromise to allow the emulator to be usable
even on systems without X Windows.)

<p>
There is no way to send an actual CTRL-B to the emulated program, when
typing in the main controlling terminal window. The solution is to either
use <a href="configfiles.html">configuration files</a>, or use
<tt><b>-x</b></tt>. Both these solutions cause new xterms to be opened for 
each emulated serial port that is written to. CTRL-B and CTRL-C both have 
their original meaning in those xterm windows.





<p><br>
<a name="cpus"></a>
<h3>Which processor architectures does GXemul emulate?</h3>

The architectures that are emulated well enough to let at least one 
guest operating system run (per architecture) are ARM, MIPS, and 
PowerPC.





<p><br>
<a name="hosts"></a>
<h3>Which host architectures are supported?</h3>

As of release 0.4.0 of GXemul, the old binary translation subsystem, which 
was used for emulation of MIPS processors on Alpha and i386 hosts, has 
been removed. The current dynamic translation subsystem should work on any 
host.





<p><br>
<a name="translation"></a>
<h3>What kind of translation does GXemul use?</h3>

<b>Static vs. dynamic:</b>

<p>In order to support guest operating systems, which can overwrite old 
code pages in memory with new code, it is necessary to translate code 
dynamically. It is not possible to do a "one-pass" (static) translation.
Self-modifying code and Just-in-Time compilers running inside 
the emulator are other things that would not work with a static 
translator. GXemul is a dynamic translator. However, it does not 
necessarily translate into native code, like many other emulators.

<p><b>"Runnable" Intermediate Representation:</b>

<p>Dynamic translators usually translate from the emulated architecture
(e.g. MIPS) into a kind of <i>intermediate representation</i> (IR), and then
to native code (e.g. AMD64 or x86 code). Since one of my main goals for
GXemul is to keep everything as portable as possible, I have tried to make
sure that the IR is something which can be executed regardless of whether 
the final step (translation from IR to native code) has been implemented
or not.

<p>The IR in GXemul consists of arrays of pointers to functions, and a few 
arguments which are passed along to those functions. The functions are 
implemented in either manually hand-coded C, or automatically generated C.
In any case, this is all statically linked into the GXemul binary at link 
time.

<p>Here is a simplified diagram of how these arrays work.

<p><center><img src="simplified_dyntrans.png"></center>

<p>There is one instruction call slot for every possible program counter
location. In the MIPS case, instruction words are 32 bits in length,
and pages are (usually) 4 KB large, resulting in 1024 instruction call
slots. After the last of these instruction calls, there is an additional
call to a special "end of page" function (which doesn't count as an executed
instruction). This function switches to the first instruction
on the next virtual page (which might cause exceptions, etc).

<p>The complexity of individual instructions vary. A simple example of
what an instruction can look like is the MIPS <tt>addiu</tt> instruction:
<pre>
	X(addiu)
	{
	        reg(ic->arg[1]) = (int32_t)
	            ((int32_t)reg(ic->arg[0]) + (int32_t)ic->arg[2]);
	}
</pre>

<p>It stores the result of a 32-bit addition of the register at arg[0]
with the immediate value arg[2] (treating both as signed 32-bit
integers) into register arg[1]. If the emulated CPU is a 64-bit CPU,
then this will store a correctly sign-extended value into arg[1].
If it is a 32-bit CPU, then only the lowest 32 bits will be stored,
and the high part ignored. <tt>X(addiu)</tt> is expanded to
<tt>mips_instr_addiu</tt> in the 64-bit case, and <tt>mips32_instr_addiu</tt>
in the 32-bit case. Both are compiled into the GXemul executable; no code 
is created during run-time.

<p>Here are examples of what the <tt>addiu</tt> instruction actually
looks like when it is compiled, on various host architectures:

</table></center>

<p>On 64-bit hosts, there is not much difference, but on 32-bit hosts (and
to some extent on AMD64), the difference is enough to make it worthwhile.


<p><b>Performance:</b>

<p>The performance of using this kind of runnable IR is obviously lower
than what can be achieved by emulators using native code generation, but
can be significantly higher than using a naive fetch-decode-execute
interpretation loop. In my opinion, using a runnable IR is an interesting
compromise.

<p>The overhead per emulated instruction is usually around or below
approximately 10 host instructions. This is very much dependent on your
host architecture and what compiler and compiler switches you are using.
Added to this instruction count is (of course) also the C code used to
implement each specific instruction.

<p><b>Instruction Combinations:</b>

<p>Short, common instruction sequences can sometimes be replaced by a 
"compound" instruction. An example could be a compare instruction followed 
by a conditional branch instruction. The advantages of instruction 
combinations are that
<ul>
  <li>the amortized overhead per instruction is slightly reduced, and
  <p>
  <li>the host's compiler can make a good job at optimizing the common
	instruction sequence.
</ul>

<p>The special cases where instruction combinations give the most gain
are in the cores of string/memory manipulation functions such as 
<tt>memset()</tt> or <tt>strlen()</tt>. The core loop can then (at least
to some extent) be replaced by a native call to the equivalent function.

<p>The implementations of compound instructions still keep track of the
number of executed instructions, etc. When single-stepping, these
translations are invalidated, and replaced by normal instruction calls
(one per emulated instruction).

<p><b>Native Code Back-ends: (not in this release)</b>

<p>In theory, it will be possible to implement native code generation
(similar to what is used in high-performance emulators such as QEMU),
as long as that generated code abides to the C ABI on the host, but
for now I wanted to make sure that GXemul works without such native
code back-ends. For this reason, as of release 0.4.0, GXemul is
completely free of native code back-ends.






<p><br>
<a name="accuracy"></a>
<h3>Emulation accuracy:</h3>

GXemul is an instruction-level emulator; things that would happen in
several steps within a real CPU are not taken into account (e.g. pipe-line
stalls or out-of-order execution). Still, instruction-level accuracy seems
to be enough to be able to run complete guest operating systems inside the
emulator.

<p>The existance of instruction and data caches is "faked" to let
operating systems think that they are there, but for all practical
purposes, these caches are non-working.

<p>The emulator is <i>not</i> timing-accurate, neither at the instruction
level nor on any higher level. An attempt is made to let emulated clocks
run at the same speed as the host (i.e. an emulated timer running at 100
Hz will interrupt around 100 times per real second), but since the host
speed may vary, e.g. because of other running processes, there is no
guarantee as to how many instructions will be executed in each of these
100 Hz cycles.

<p>If the host is very slow, the emulated clocks might even lag behind
the real-world clock.






<p><br>
<a name="emulmodes"></a>
<h3>Which machines does GXemul emulate?</h3>

A few different machine types are emulated. The following machine types 
are emulated well enough to run at least one "guest OS":

<p>There is code in GXemul for emulation of many other machine types; the
degree to which these work range from almost being able to run a complete
OS, to almost completely unsupported (perhaps just enough support to
output a few boot messages via serial console).

<p>In addition to emulating real machines, there is also a "test-machine".
A test-machine consists of one or more CPUs and a few experimental devices
such as:

<p>
<ul>
  <li>a console I/O device (putchar() and getchar()...)
  <li>an inter-processor communication device, for SMP experiments
  <li>a very simple linear framebuffer device (for graphics output)
  <li>a simple SCSI disk controller
  <li>a simple ethernet controller
</ul>

<p>This mode is useful if you wish to run experimental code, but do not
wish to target any specific real-world machine type, for example for
educational purposes.

<p>You can read more about these experimental devices <a
