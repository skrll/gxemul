<a name="overview"></a>
<h3>Overview:</h3>

GXemul is a machine emulator, which can be used to experiment with
binary code for (among others) MIPS-based machines. Several emulation
modes are available. For some emulation modes, processors and surrounding
hardware components are emulated well enough to let unmodified operating
systems run as if they were running on a real machine.

<p>
It is important to keep in mind that devices and CPUs are not really
emulated correctly, they are only "faked" well enough to make eg. NetBSD
run. Still, the emulator could be of interest for academic research and
experiments, such as when learning how to write an OS for a real machine,
or profiling SMP, memory, or system call usage.

<p>
The emulator is written in C, does not depend on external libraries (except
X11, but that is optional), and should compile and run on most Unix-like
systems. If it doesn't, then that is a bug.

<p>
The emulator contains code which tries to emulate the workings of CPUs and
surrounding hardware found in real machines, but it does not contain any
ROM code. You will need some form of program (in binary form) to run in 
the emulator. For many emulation modes, PROM calls are handled by the 
emulator itself, so you do not need to use any ROM image at all.

<p>
You can use pre-compiled kernels (for example NetBSD kernels, or Linux),
or other programs that are in binary format, and in some cases even actual
ROM images. A couple of different file formats are supported (ELF, a.out,
ECOFF, SREC, raw binaries).

<p>
(You do not need any MIPS compiler toolchain to build or use GXemul.
If you need to compile MIPS binaries from sources, then of course you need 
such a toolchain, but that is completely separate from GXemul. There
is a <a href="technical.html#regtest">regression testing</a> framework,
which requires that a GNU CC for mips64-unknown-elf or similar is available.
For simply building and using the emulator, it is not required.) 





<p><br>
<a name="free"></a>
<h3>Is GXemul free software?</h3>

Yes. I have released GXemul under a free license.
(For a definitions of the four freedoms associated with free software,
please read <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html</a>.)

<p>
The code I have written is released under a 3-clause BSD-style license
(or "revised BSD-style" if one wants to use
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/bsd.html">GNU jargon</a>.)
Apart from the code I have written, some files are copied from other sources
such as NetBSD, for example header files containing symbolic names of
bitfields in device registers. They are also covered by similar licenses,
but with some additional clauses. If you plan to redistribute GXemul
(for example as a binary package), or reuse code from GXemul,
then you should check those files for their license terms.

<p>
(The licenses usually require that the original Copyright and license 
terms are included when you make a copy or modification. The "easiest way 
out" if you plan to redistribute code from GXemul is to simply supply 
the source code. You should however check individual files for details.)





<p><br>
<a name="build"></a>
<h3>How to compile/build the emulator:</h3>

Uncompress the .tar.gz distribution file, and run
<pre>
	$ <b>./configure</b>
	$ <b>make</b>
</pre>

<p>
This should work on most Unix-like systems. If it doesn't, then please
mail me a bug report.

<p>
(Note for Windows users: there is a possibility that some releases 
and/or snapshots will also work with Cygwin, but I can't promise that.)

<p>
The emulator's performance is highly dependent on both runtime settings
and on compiler settings, so you might want to experiment with different
CC and CFLAGS environment variable values. For example, on a modern PC, 
you could try the following:
<p>
<pre>
        $ <b>CFLAGS="-mcpu=pentium4 -O3" ./configure</b>
        $ <b>make</b>
</pre>

<p>
Run <b>./configure --help</b> to get a list of configure options. (The 
possible options differ between different releases and snapshots.)

<p>
Once you have built GXemul, running it should be rather straight-forward.
To exit the emulator, type CTRL-C to enter the 
single-step debugger, and then type <b>quit</b>. By typing CTRL-B instead,
a CTRL-C is sent to the emulated program.






<p><br>
<a name="cpus"></a>
<h3>Which CPU types does GXemul emulate?</h3>

<h4>MIPS:</h4>

Emulation of R4000, which is a 64-bit CPU, was my initial goal. Right
now, R2000/R3000-like CPUs are also emulated (32-bit), and emulation of
R1x000 (at least the parts that are similar to R4000) is beginning to work
as expected. Code targeted for MIPS32 and MIPS64 also often work.

<p>
I have written an experimental dynamic binary translation subsystem.
This gives higher total performance than interpreting one instruction at a
time and executing it. (If you wish to enable bintrans, add <b>-b</b> to
the command line, but keep in mind that it is still experimental.)



<h4>URISC:</h4>

I have implemented an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URISC">URISC</a>
emulation mode, just for fun. The only instruction available in an URISC
machine is "reverse subtract and skip on borrow". (It is probably not
worth trying to do bintrans with URISC, because any reasonable URISC
program relies on self-modifying code, which is bad for bintrans
performance.)




<h4>Other CPU types:</h4>

There is some code for POWER/PowerPC emulation too, but it only works 
for "Hello World" and similarly trivial programs.
(There are some other CPU modes too, but they are working even less.)





<p><br>
<a name="accuracy"></a>
<h3>Emulation accuracy:</h3>

GXemul is an instruction-level simulator; things that would happen in
several steps within a real CPU are not taken into account (eg. pipe-line
stages or out-of-order execution). Still, instruction-level accuracy seems 
to be enough to be able to run complete guest operating systems inside the 
emulator.





<p><br>
<a name="emulmodes"></a>
<h3>Which machines does GXemul emulate?</h3>

A few different machine types are emulated. The machine types that are
emulated best at the moment are:

<p>
<ul>
  <li><b>DECstation 5000/200</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;("pmax")
	<br>(Serial controller (including keyboard and mouse), ethernet,
	SCSI, and graphical framebuffers.)
  <p>
  <li><b>Acer Pica-61</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;(an ARC machine)
	<br>(Serial controller, "VGA" text console, and SCSI.)
  <p>
  <li><b>NEC MobilePro 770, 780, 800, and 880</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;(HPCmips machines)
	<br>(Framebuffer, keyboard, and a PCMCIA IDE controller.)
</ul>

<p>
There is code in GXemul for emulation of many other machine types;
the degree to which these work range from "almost" being able to run
a complete OS, to almost completely unsupported (perhaps just enough
support to output a few boot messages via serial console).

<p>
In addition to specific machine types, a "test-machine" can be emulated.
A test-machine consists of one or more CPUs and a few experimental 
devices such as:

<p>
<ul>
  <li>a console I/O device (putchar() and getchar()...)
  <li>an inter-processor communication device, for SMP experiments
  <li>a very simple linear framebuffer device (for graphics output)
</ul>

<p>
This mode is useful if you wish to run experimental code, but do not
wish to target any specific real-world machine type, for example for
educational purposes.

<p>
You can read more about these experimental devices

<a name="guestos"></a>
<h3>Which guest OSes are possible to run?</h3>

This table sums up the guest OSes that run well enough to be considered
working in the emulator. They can boot from a harddisk image and be
interacted with similar to a real machine:

<p><br>

(<super>*</super> Although Linux runs under DECstation emulation, the 
default kernel in Debian GNU/Linux does not support keyboards on the 5000/200
(the specific DECstation model being emulated), so when the login prompt
is reached you cannot interact with the system.
Kaj-Michael Lang has compiled and made available a newer kernel from the
current mips-linux development tree. You can find it here:
<a href="http://home.tal.org/~milang/o2/kernels/">http://home.tal.org/~milang/o2/kernels</a>/<a href="http://home.tal.org/~milang/o2/kernels/vmlinux-2.4.29-rc2-r3k-mipsel-decstation">vmlinux-2.4.29-rc2-r3k-mipsel-decstation</a>
This newer kernel supports keyboard input, but it does not have Debian's
ethernet patches, so you will not be able to use keyboard/framebuffer 
<i>and</i> networking at the same time.)


<p>
It is non-trivial to get a specific operating system or OS kernel to
run in the emulator, so don't expect the list above to grow too quickly.

<p>
There is no guarantee that anything specific will run in the emulator, but
NetBSD is a good starting point for someone who wants to experiment.
