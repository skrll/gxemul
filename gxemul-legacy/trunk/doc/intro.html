<h1>GXemul: Introduction</h1>
<hr><p>

<a href="./">Back to the index.</a>


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>GXemul is an experimental framework for
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_virtualization">full-system</a>
emulation. This means that, in addition to emulating processors, 
surrounding devices and peripherals are also emulated.

<p>GXemul 0.5.0 is a complete rewrite of GXemul in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a>. Previous versions
were written in plain
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29">C</a>.
The two main reasons for rewriting in C++ was 1) that I wanted to learn C++
a bit more, and 2) that GXemul had stagnated feature-wise, and I needed
a fresh start in order to to build a better base platform.

<p>Thanks to (in no specific order) Joachim Buss, Olivier Houchard, Juli 
Mallett, Juan Romero Pardines, Carl van Schaik, Miod Vallat, Alec Voropay,
GÃ¶ran Weinholt, Alexander Yurchenko, and everyone else who has provided me
with feedback on previous versions of GXemul.

<p>GXemul's homepage is
<a href="http://gavare.se/gxemul/">http://gavare.se/gxemul/</a>.

<p>If you have found GXemul useful in some way, or feel like sending me 
comments or feedback in general, then mail me at&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>anders <i>(at)</i> gavare.se</tt>.


<p><br><h3><a name="build">How to build GXemul</a></h3>

<p>If you are lucky, your OS vendor has already packaged GXemul for your
particular platform. If so, then please refer to your OS on how to
download/install GXemul. E.g. on <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>,
you would usually execute<pre>
	<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=pkg_add&apropos=0&sektion=0&format=html">pkg_add</a> -r <a href="http://www.freshports.org/emulators/gxemul/">gxemul</a>
</pre>
as root. That will install GXemul as a binary package.

<p>Another example is on Debian GNU/Linux, where the corresponding command
line is:<pre>
	apt-get install <a href="http://packages.debian.org/gxemul">gxemul</a>
</pre>

<p>In case GXemul is not available as a pre-built package for your OS,
or it is available but only an older version, or if you feel like
compiling from source code directly, or if you do not have root 
access on your system, simply download the GXemul distribution and run:<pre>
	./configure
	make
</pre>

<p>This should work on most Unix-like platforms. (If it does 
not work for you, then please mail me a detailed bug report, including
the output of <tt>uname -a</tt>, the <tt>configure</tt> and <tt>make</tt>
output, and any other useful information.)

<p>(Using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygwin">Cygwin</a>
 might work as well, but this is not really supported.)

<p>GXemul depends on the following external libraries and tools:
<ul>
        <li>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gtkmm">gtkmm</a>
		libraries and header files (gtkmm-2.4 >= 2.12.1),
                for the GUI.
        <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxygen">Doxygen</a>, 
		for building C++ class documentation.
</ul>

<p>Note, however, that both gtkmm and Doxygen are <i>optional</i>
dependencies. GXemul will build without them. If gtkmm is missing, the
<tt>gxemul-gui</tt> binary will not work, but you can still use the 
text-only variant, <tt>gxemul</tt>. If Doxygen is missing, the
installed documentation will not include the
<a href="doxygen/html/index.html">source code reference</a>.

<p>To install, type <tt>make install</tt>. This installs binaries,
man pages, and documentation under <tt>/usr/local</tt>, unless the
<tt>PREFIX</tt> environment variable was set prior to running
<tt>configure</tt>. (You need to have write permission to the 
corresponding directories to do this.)




<p><br><h3><a name="free">Is GXemul Free software?</a></h3>

Yes. I have released GXemul under a Free license. The code in GXemul is
Copyrighted software, it is <i>not</i> public domain. (If this is
confusing to you, you might want to read up on the definitions of the
four freedoms associated with Free software, <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html</a>.)

<p>The code I have written is released under a 3-clause BSD-style license
(or "revised BSD-style" if one wants to use <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/bsd.html">GNU jargon</a>). Apart from
the code I have written, some files are copied from other sources such as
NetBSD, for example header files containing symbolic names of bitfields in
device registers. They are also covered by similar licenses, but with some
additional clauses. The main point, however, is that the licenses require
that the original Copyright and license terms are included when you make a
copy or modification.

<p>If you plan to redistribute GXemul <i>without</i> supplying the source
code, then you need to comply with each individual source file some other
way, for example by writing additional documentation containing copyright
notes. I have not done this, since I do not plan on making distributions
without source code. You need to check all individual files for details.
The "easiest way out" if you plan to redistribute code from GXemul is, of
course, to let it remain Free Software and simply include the source code.

<p>In case you want to reuse parts of GXemul, but you need to do that 
under a different license (e.g. the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GPL</a>), then contact me and 
I can probably re-license/dual-license files on a case-by-case basis.
