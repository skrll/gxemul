<a name="overview"></a>
<h3>Overview:</h3>

GXemul is an experimental instruction-level machine emulator. Several
emulation modes are available. In some modes, processors and surrounding
hardware components are emulated well enough to let unmodified operating
systems (e.g. NetBSD) run as if they were running on a real machine.

<p>Devices and processors are not simulated with 100% accuracy. They are 
only ``faked'' well enough to allow guest operating systems to run without 
complaining too much. Still, the emulator could be of interest for 
academic research and experiments, such as when learning how to write 
operating system code.

<p>The emulator is written in C, does not depend on third-party libraries,
and should compile and run on most 64-bit and 32-bit Unix-like systems.

<p>The emulator contains code which tries to emulate the workings of CPUs
and surrounding hardware found in real machines, but it does not contain
any ROM code. You will need some form of program (in binary form) to run
in the emulator. For many emulation modes, PROM calls are handled by the
emulator itself, so you do not need to use any ROM image at all.

<p>You can use pre-compiled kernels (for example NetBSD kernels, or
Linux), or other programs that are in binary format, and in some cases
even actual ROM images. A couple of different file formats are supported
(ELF, a.out, ECOFF, SREC, and raw binaries).

<p>If you do not have a kernel as a separate file, but you have a bootable
disk image, then it is sometimes possible to boot directly from that
image. (This works for example with DECstation emulation, Dreamcast 
emulation, or when booting from generic ISO9660 CDROM images if the 
kernel is included in the image as a plain file.)

<p>Thanks to (in no specific order) Joachim Buss, Olivier Houchard, Juli 
Mallett, Juan Romero Pardines, Carl van Schaik, Alec Voropay, Göran
Weinholt, Alexander Yurchenko, and everyone else who has provided me with
feedback.

<a name="free"></a>
<h3>Is GXemul Free software?</h3>

Yes. I have released GXemul under a Free license. The code in GXemul is
Copyrighted software, it is <i>not</i> public domain. (If this is
confusing to you, you might want to read up on the definitions of the
four freedoms associated with Free software, <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html</a>.)

<p>The code I have written is released under a 3-clause BSD-style license
(or "revised BSD-style" if one wants to use <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/bsd.html">GNU jargon</a>). Apart from
the code I have written, some files are copied from other sources such as
NetBSD, for example header files containing symbolic names of bitfields in
device registers. They are also covered by similar licenses, but with some
additional clauses. The main point, however, is that the licenses require
that the original Copyright and license terms are included when you make a
copy or modification.

<p>If you plan to redistribute GXemul <i>without</i> supplying the source
code, then you need to comply with each individual source file some other
way, for example by writing additional documentation containing copyright
notes. I have not done this, since I do not plan on making distributions
without source code. You need to check all individual files for details.
The "easiest way out" if you plan to redistribute code from GXemul is, of
course, to let it remain open source and simply supply the source code.

<p>In case you want to reuse parts of GXemul, but you need to do that 
under a different license (e.g. the GPL), then contact me and I might 
re-license/dual-license files on a case-by-case basis.





<p><br>
<a name="build"></a>
<h3>How to compile/build the emulator:</h3>

Uncompress the .tar.gz distribution file, and run
<pre>
	$ <b>./configure</b>
	$ <b>make</b>
</pre>

<p>This should work on most Unix-like systems. GXemul does not require any 
specific libraries to build, however, if you build on a system which does 
not have X11 libraries installed, some functionality will be lost.

<p>The emulator's performance is highly dependent on both runtime settings
and on compiler settings, so you might want to experiment with different
CC and CFLAGS environment variable values. For example, on an AMD Athlon
host, you might want to try setting <tt>CFLAGS</tt> to <tt>-march=athlon</tt>
before running <tt>configure</tt>.







<p><br>
<a name="run"></a>
<h3>How to run the emulator:</h3>

Once you have built GXemul, running it should be rather straight-forward.
Running <tt><b>gxemul</b></tt> without arguments (or with the
<b><tt>-h</tt></b> or <b><tt>-H</tt></b> command line options) will
display a help message.

<p>
To get some ideas about what is possible to run in the emulator, please 
read the section about <a href="guestoses.html">installing "guest" 
operating systems</a>. If you are interested in using the emulator to 
develop code on your own, then you should also read the section about
<a href="experiments.html#hello">Hello World</a>.

<p>
To exit the emulator, type CTRL-C to enter the 
single-step debugger, and then type <tt><b>quit</b></tt>.

<p>
If you are starting an emulation by entering settings directly on the 
command line, and you are not using the <tt><b>-x</b></tt> option, then all 
terminal input and output will go to the main controlling terminal.
CTRL-C is used to break into the debugger, so in order to send CTRL-C to 
the running (emulated) program, you may use CTRL-B.
(This should be a reasonable compromise to allow the emulator to be usable
even on systems without X Windows.)

<p>
There is no way to send an actual CTRL-B to the emulated program, when
typing in the main controlling terminal window. The solution is to either
use <a href="configfiles.html">configuration files</a>, or use
<tt><b>-x</b></tt>. Both these solutions cause new xterms to be opened for 
each emulated serial port that is written to. CTRL-B and CTRL-C both have 
their original meaning in those xterm windows.





<p><br>
<a name="cpus"></a>
<h3>Which processor architectures does GXemul emulate?</h3>

The architectures that are emulated well enough to let at least one 
guest operating system run (per architecture) are ARM, MIPS, PowerPC,
and SuperH.

<p>Please read the page about <a href="guestoses.html">guest operating
systems</a> for more information about the machines and operating systems 
that can be considered "working" in the emulator.






<p><br>
<a name="hosts"></a>
<h3>Which host architectures are supported?</h3>

GXemul should compile and run on any modern host architecture (64-bit or 
32-bit word-length).

<p>Note: The <a href="translation.html">dynamic translation</a> engine 
does <i>not</i> require backends for native code generation to be written 
for each individual host architecture; the intermediate representation 
that the dyntrans system uses can be executed on any host architecture.





<p><br>
<a name="accuracy"></a>
<h3>Emulation accuracy:</h3>

GXemul is an instruction-level emulator; things that would happen in
several steps within a real CPU are not taken into account (e.g. pipe-line
stalls or out-of-order execution). Still, instruction-level accuracy seems
to be enough to be able to run complete guest operating systems inside the
emulator.

<p>The existance of instruction and data caches is "faked" to let
operating systems think that they are there, but for all practical
purposes, these caches are non-working.

<p>The emulator is in general <i>not</i> timing-accurate, neither at the
instruction level nor on any higher level. An attempt is made to let
emulated clocks run at the same speed as the host (i.e. an emulated timer
running at 100 Hz will interrupt around 100 times per real second), but
since the host speed may vary, e.g. because of other running processes,
there is no guarantee as to how many instructions will be executed in
each of these 100 Hz cycles.

<p>If the host is very slow, the emulated clocks might even lag behind
the real-world clock.






<p><br>
<a name="emulmodes"></a>
<h3>Which machines does GXemul emulate?</h3>

A few different machine types are emulated. The following machine types 
are emulated well enough to run at least one "guest OS":

<p>
<ul>
  <li><b><u>ARM</u></b>

    <li><b>NEC MobilePro 770, 780, 800, 880</b> (<a href="guestoses.html#netbsdhpcmipsinstall">NetBSD/hpcmips</a>)
    <li><b>Cobalt</b> (<a href="guestoses.html#netbsdcobaltinstall">NetBSD/cobalt</a>)
    <li><b>Malta</b> (<a href="guestoses.html#netbsdevbmipsinstall">NetBSD/evbmips</a>, Linux/Malta <font color="#0000e0">(<super>*1</super>)</font>)
    <li><b>Algorithmics P5064</b> (<a href="guestoses.html#netbsdalgorinstall">NetBSD/algor</a>)
    <li><b>SGI O2 (aka IP32)</b> <font color="#0000e0">(<super>*2</super>)</font>
	(<a href="guestoses.html#netbsdsgimips">NetBSD/sgi</a>)
  </ul>
  <p>
  <li><b><u>PowerPC</u></b>
  <ul>
    <li><b>IBM 6050/6070 (PReP, PowerPC Reference Platform)</b> (<a href="guestoses.html#netbsdprepinstall">NetBSD/prep</a>)
    <li><b>MacPPC (generic "G4" Macintosh)</b> (<a href="guestoses.html#netbsdmacppcinstall">NetBSD/macppc</a>)
  </ul>
  <p>
  <li><b><u>SuperH</u></b>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Sega Dreamcast</b> (<a href="dreamcast.html#netbsd_generic_md">NetBSD/dreamcast</a>, <a href="dreamcast.html#linux_live_cd">Linux/dreamcast</a>)
    <li><b>Landisk I-O DATA USL-5P</b> (<a href="guestoses.html#openbsdlandiskinstall">OpenBSD/landisk</a>)
  </ul>
</ul>

<p>
<small><font color="#0000e0">(<super>*1</super>)</font> =
Linux/Malta may be run as a guest OS, however I have not yet found any stable
URL to pre-compiled Linux/Malta kernels. Thus, Linux/Malta emulation is not
tested for every release of the emulator; sometimes it works, sometimes
it doesn't.</small>

<br><small><font color="#0000e0">(<super>*2</super>)</font> =
SGI O2 emulation is enough for root-on-nfs, but not for disk boot.</small>

<p>Note that of all of the machines above, none of them is emulated to 
100%. The most complete emulation mode is probably the DECstation 
5000/200. Things that will most likely <b>not</b> work includes running 
raw PROM images for most machines, SGI IRIX, MacOS X or Darwin, Windows 
NT, or Dreamcast games.

<p>There is code in GXemul for emulation of many other machine types; the
degree to which these work range from almost being able to run a complete
OS, to almost completely unsupported (perhaps just enough support to
output a few boot messages via serial console).

<p>In addition to emulating real machines, there is also a "test-machine".
A test-machine consists of one or more CPUs and a few experimental devices
such as:

<p>
<ul>
  <li>a console I/O device (putchar() and getchar()...)
  <li>an inter-processor communication device, for SMP experiments
  <li>a very simple linear framebuffer device (for graphics output)
  <li>a simple disk controller
  <li>a simple ethernet controller
  <li>a real-time clock device
</ul>

<p>This mode is useful if you wish to run experimental code, but do not
wish to target any specific real-world machine type, for example for
educational purposes.

<p>You can read more about these experimental devices <a
href="experiments.html#expdevices">here</a>.
