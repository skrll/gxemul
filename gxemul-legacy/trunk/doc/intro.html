<h1>GXemul: Introduction</h1>
<hr><p>

<a href="./">Back to the index.</a>


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>GXemul is an experimental framework for
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_virtualization">full-system</a>
emulation. This means that, in addition to emulating processors, 
surrounding devices and peripherals are also emulated.

<p>GXemul 0.5.0 is a complete rewrite of GXemul in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a>. Previous versions
were written in plain
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29">C</a>.
The main two reasons for rewriting in C++ was 1) that I wanted to learn C++
a bit more, and 2) that GXemul had stagnated feature-wise, and I needed
a fresh start in order to to build a better base platform.

<p>Thanks to (in no specific order) Joachim Buss, Olivier Houchard, Juli 
Mallett, Juan Romero Pardines, Carl van Schaik, Miod Vallat, Alec Voropay,
GÃ¶ran Weinholt, Alexander Yurchenko, and everyone else who has provided me
with feedback on previous versions of GXemul.

<p>GXemul's homepage is

<p>If you have found GXemul useful in some way, or feel like sending me 
comments or feedback in general, then mail me at&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>anders <i>(at)</i> gavare.se</tt>.


<p><br><h3><a name="build">How to build GXemul</a></h3>

<p>If you are lucky, your OS vendor has already packaged GXemul for your
particular platform. If so, then please refer to your OS on how to
download/install GXemul. E.g. on <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>,
you would usually execute<pre>
	<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=pkg_add&apropos=0&sektion=0&format=html">pkg_add</a> -r <a href="http://www.freshports.org/emulators/gxemul/">gxemul</a>
</pre>
as root. That will install [some version of] GXemul from the
<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/ports/">FreeBSD Ports collection</a>.

<p>In case GXemul is not available as a pre-built package for your OS,
or it is available but only an older version, or if you feel like
compiling from source code directly, simply download the GXemul
distribution and run:<pre>
	configure
	make
</pre>

<p>This should work on most Unix-like platforms. (If it does 
not work for you, then please mail me a detailed bug report, including
the output of <tt>uname -a</tt>, the <tt>configure</tt> and <tt>make</tt>
output, and any other useful information.)

<p>(Using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygwin">Cygwin</a>
 might work as well, but this is not really supported.)

<p>GXemul depends on the following external libraries and tools:
<ul>
        <li>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gtkmm">gtkmm</a>
		libraries and header files (gtkmm-2.4 >= 2.12.1),
                for the GUI.
        <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxygen">Doxygen</a>, 
		for building C++ class documentation.
</ul>

<p>Note, however, that both gtkmm and Doxygen are <i>optional</i>
dependencies. GXemul will build without them. If gtkmm is missing, the
<tt>gxemul-gui</tt> binary will not work, but you can still use the 
text-only variant, <tt>gxemul</tt>. If Doxygen is missing, the
installed documentation will not include the
<a href="doxygen/html/index.html">source code reference</a>.

<p>To install, type <tt>make install</tt>. This installs binaries,
man pages, and documentation under <tt>/usr/local</tt>, unless the
<tt>PREFIX</tt> environment variable was set prior to running
<tt>configure</tt>.
