<h3>Introduction:</h3>

GXemul has (very rudimentary) GDB serial protocol support. This means that 
you can start up GDB, or a front-end program which in turn uses GDB, and 
connect it to a running GXemul instance.

<p>The GDB front-end I use in this example is the <a 
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/ddd/">Data Display Debugger (DDD)</a>.

<p>The screenshot is of DDD connected to a small test program compiled for 
64-bit MIPS, running in GXemul.

<p>The only supported CPU architectures so far are Alpha, ARM, MIPS,
and POWER/PowerPC.





<p><br>
<a name="prerequisites"></a>
<h3>Prerequisites:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Build and install GDB for your target. You should use the same
	configuration as you did when you compiled your compiler (e.g.
	mips64-unknown-elf). Assuming you use <tt>~/crossdev</tt> for all
	your cross-development tools:<pre>
	# <b>wget <a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gdb/gdb-6.4.tar.gz">http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gdb/gdb-6.4.tar.gz</a></b>
	# <b>tar zxf gdb-6.4.tar.gz</b>
	# <b>cd gdb-6.4</b>
	# <b>./configure --prefix=$HOME/crossdev --target=mips64-unknown-elf</b>
	# <b>gmake install</b>
</pre>
	Remember to include <tt>~/crossdev/bin</tt> in your PATH.
  <p>
  <li>Optionally, but highly recommended:  Install a front-end for GDB, such 
	as DDD. In FreeBSD, this is done by:<pre>
	# <b>pkg_add -r ddd</b>
</pre>
	Other operating systems that have DDD available as a pre-compiled
	package have similar methods of installing it; otherwise you could
	try compiling DDD from source.
</ul>

You can still run a bare GDB session without a GUI front-end if you like.





<p><br>
<a name="example"></a>
<h3>Example session:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Start up GXemul, and tell it to wait for an incoming GDB connection
	on a certain port:<pre>
	# <b>gxemul -Etestmips -XY2 -G10000 x_mips_rectangles</b>

</pre>
  <p>
  <li>Start the DDD, using a GDB configured for this specific target,
	and also give the name of the binary/kernel. (This binary
	should have been compiled with <tt>-g</tt>.)<pre>
	# <b>ddd --debugger mips64-unknown-elf-gdb x_mips_rectangles</b>

</pre>
  <p>
  <li>At the <tt>(gdb)</tt> prompt in DDD, type:<pre>
	(gdb) <b>target remote localhost:10000</b>

</pre>
  <p>
  <li>Press F9 (Continue) to start. (For POWER/PowerPC targets, it might
	be necessary to Continue twice.) Press ESC when you wish to interrupt.
</ol>
