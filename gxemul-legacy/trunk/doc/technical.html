<h3>Overview</h3>

In simple terms, mips64emul is just a simple fetch-and-execute
loop; an instruction is fetched from memory, and executed.

<p>
In reality, a lot of things need to be handled. Before each instruction is 
executed, the emulator checks to see if any interrupts are asserted which 
are not masked away. If so, then an INT exception is generated. Exceptions 
cause the program counter to be set to a specific value, and some of the 
system coprocessor's registers to be set to values signifying what kind of 
exception it was (an interrupt exception in this case).

<p>
Reading instructions from memory is done through a TLB, a translation
lookaside buffer. The TLB on MIPS is software controlled, which means that 
the program running inside the emulator (for example an operating system 
kernel) has to take care of manually updating the TLB. Some memory 
addresses are translated into physical addresses directly, some are 
translated into valid physical addresses via the TLB, and some memory 
references are not valid. Invalid memory references cause exceptions.

<p>
When an instruction is read from memory, the emulator checks which opcode 
it contains and executes the instruction. Executing an instruction usually 
involves reading some register and writing some register, or perhaps a 
load from memory (or a store to memory). The program counter is increased 
for every instruction.

<p>
Some memory references point to physical addresses which are not in the 
normal RAM address space. They may point to hardware devices. If that is 
the case, then loads and stores are converted into calls to a device 
access function. The device access function is then responsible for 
handling these reads and writes.  For example, a graphical framebuffer 
device may put a pixel on the screen when a value is written to it, or a 
serial controller device may output a character to stdout when written to.

<h3>Emulation of hardware device</h3>

Basically, each file in the device/ directory is responsible for one hardware 
device. These are used from src/machine.c, when initializing which hardware a
particular machine model will be using.
<p>
(I'll be using the name 'foo' as the name of the device in all these
examples.  This is pseudo code, it might need some modification to 
actually compile and run.)
<p>
Each device should have the following:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>An init function in dev_foo.c. It would typically look
	something like this:
<pre>
	void dev_foo_init(struct cpu *cpu, struct memory *mem,
	    uint64_t baseaddr, int irq_nr)
	{
		struct foo_data *d;

		d = malloc(sizeof(struct foo_data));
		if (d == NULL) {
			fprintf(stderr, "out of memory\n");
			exit(1);
		}
		memset(d, 0, sizeof(struct foo_data));
		d->irq_nr = irq_nr;

		memory_device_register(mem, "foo", baseaddr,
		    DEV_FOO_LENGTH, dev_foo_access, d);

		/*  This should only be here if the device
		    has a tick function:  */
		cpu_add_tickfunction(cpu, dev_foo_tick, d,
		    FOO_TICKSHIFT);
	}
</pre><br>

  <li>The init function, the access function (described further down)
	and DEV_FOO_LENGTH should be defined in include/devices.h.
  <p>
  <li>At the top of dev_foo.c, the foo_data struct should be defined.
<pre>
	struct foo_data {
		int	irq_nr;
		/*  ...  */
	}
</pre><br>

  <li>If foo has a tick function (that is, something that needs to be
	run at regular intervals) then FOO_TICKSHIFT and a tick function
	need to be defined as well:
<pre>
	#define FOO_TICKSHIFT		10

	void dev_foo_tick(struct cpu *cpu, void *extra)
	{
		struct foo_data *d = (struct foo_data *) extra;

		if (.....)
			cpu_interrupt(cpu, d->irq_nr);
		else
			cpu_interrupt_ack(cpu, d->irq_nr);
	}
</pre><br>

  <li>And last but not least, the device should have an access function.
	The access function is called whenever there is a load or store
	to an address which is in the device' memory mapped region.
<pre>
	int dev_foo_access(struct cpu *cpu, struct memory *mem,
	    uint64_t relative_addr, unsigned char *data, size_t len,
	    int writeflag, void *extra)
	{
		struct foo_data *d = extra;
		uint64_t idata = 0, odata = 0;

		idata = memory_readmax64(cpu, data, len);
		switch (relative_addr) {
		/* .... */
		}

		if (writeflag == MEM_READ)
			memory_writemax64(cpu, data, len, odata);

		/*  Perhaps interrupts need to be asserted or
		    deasserted:  */
		dev_foo_tick(cpu, extra);

		/*  Return successfully.  */
		return 1;
	}
</pre><br>
</ul>
<p>
The return value of the access function has until 20040702 been a 
true/false value; 1 for success, or 0 for device access failure. A device 
access failure will be seen as a MIPS DBE exception from the CPU.
<p>
Right now I'm converting the devices to support arbitrary memory latency 
values. The return value is now the number of cycles that the read or 
write access took. A value of 1 means one cycle, a value of 10 means 10 
cycles. Negative values are used for device access failures, and the 
absolute value of the value is then the number of cycles; a value of -5 
means that the access failed, and took 5 cycles.
<p>
To be compatible with pre-20040702 devices, a return value of 0 is treated 
by the caller (in src/memory.c) as a value of -1.
