<h3>Overview</h3>

In simple terms, mips64emul is just a simple fetch-and-execute
loop; an instruction is fetched from memory, and executed.

<p>
In reality, a lot of things need to be handled. Before each instruction is 
executed, the emulator checks to see if any interrupts are asserted which 
are not masked away. If so, then an INT exception is generated. Exceptions 
cause the program counter to be set to a specific value, and some of the 
system coprocessor's registers to be set to values signifying what kind of 
exception it was (an interrupt exception in this case).

<p>
Reading instructions from memory is done through a TLB, a translation
lookaside buffer. The TLB on MIPS is software controlled, which means that 
the program running inside the emulator (for example an operating system 
kernel) has to take care of manually updating the TLB. Some memory 
addresses are translated into physical addresses directly, some are 
translated into valid physical addresses via the TLB, and some memory 
references are not valid. Invalid memory references cause exceptions.

<p>
When an instruction is read from memory, the emulator checks which opcode 
it contains and executes the instruction. Executing an instruction usually 
involves reading some register and writing some register, or perhaps a 
load from memory (or a store to memory). The program counter is increased 
for every instruction.

<p>
Some memory references point to physical addresses which are not in the 
normal RAM address space. They may point to hardware devices. If that is 
the case, then loads and stores are converted into calls to a device 
access function. The device access function is then responsible for 
handling these reads and writes.  For example, a graphical framebuffer 
device may put a pixel on the screen when a value is written to it, or a 
serial controller device may output a character to stdout when written to.
