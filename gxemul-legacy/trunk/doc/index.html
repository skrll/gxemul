<h4>Overview:</h4>

mips64emul is a MIPS machine emulator.

The goals are to emulate 32-bit and 64-bit MIPS CPUs and enough surrounding hardware
to fake real machines, capable of running real (unmodified) operating systems,
such as <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a> or <a href="http://www.kernel.org/">Linux</a>.
This is a spare time hobby project, and many things are not implemented yet.
<p> 
The emulator could be of interest for academic research and experiments, such as
learning how to write an OS for a MIPS-based machine, or profiling SMP,
memory usage, or system call patterns.
<p>
The emulator is written in C, depends on no external libraries (except X11,
which is optional), and should compile and run on any Unix-like system. If it doesn't, that
is to be considered a bug. No MIPS compiler toolchain is needed if the program you
wish to run in the emulator is already in binary form. No ROM images are
needed, the emulator will try to emulate things such as PROM calls by
itself. However, if you have a ROM image, it might be possible to run it
in the emulator.

<h4>Is mips64emul free software?</h4>

Yes, mips64emul is distributed under a free license.
(A 2-clause BSD-style license, or "revised BSD-style" if one wants to use
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/bsd.html">GNU jargon</a>.)
<p>
Apart from the code I have written, some files are copied from other sources such
as NetBSD, for example header files containing symbolic names of bitfields in device
registers. They are also covered by similar licences. Please check individual files if
you plan to reuse code from mips64emul.


<p><br>
<a name="emulmodes"></a>
<h4>Which machines does mips64emul emulate?</h4>

A few different machine types are emulated. Here, "emulated" does not mean
that the machine type is emulated <i>well</i>, just that there is such
an emulation mode.

<ul>
  <li>DECstation/DECsystem machines, made by Digital Equipment Corp.
  <li>Silicon Graphics MIPS-based machines
  <li>A NEC RISCstation 2250 (an "ARC" compliant machine)
  <li>Cobalt
  <li>Sony Playstation 2
  <li>Handheld "hpcmips" devices
</ul>
<p>
Some notes about the list above:  The machines above have 64-bit
capable CPUs, except most DECstations. There were upgrades from R3000 to
R4000 available for some DECstations, but Ultrix was still running in 32-bit
mode (I think).  Unfortunately, even if most of these machine types have
64-bit CPUs in them (or even 128-bit, the Playstation 2's R5900 CPU
is a bit weird), operating systems often run in 32-bit mode on them.
<p>
There are other machines that use/used MIPS cpus, for example the
Playstation (1) and the Nintendo 64 game systems, but no free OS is ported
to those platforms as far as I know, so they might not be too interesting
to emulate.
<p>
Playstation 2 is among the emulated machine types, but the emulation done
by mips64emul is <i>not</i> suitable for playing games. Running Linux and
NetBSD is a lot more fun :-)
<p>
In addition to specific machine types, a "bare" machine can be emulated.
This mode is used when the emulator is started without specifying which
machine type to emulate.
A bare machine consists of just a CPU and some experimental devices such
as:
<ul>
  <li>a console I/O device (think putchar() and getchar()...)
  <li>an inter-processor communication device, for SMP experiments
</ul>


<p><br>
<a name="build"></a>
<h4>How to compile/build the emulator:</h4>

Uncompress the .tar.gz file, and run
<pre>
	$ <b>./configure</b>
	$ <b>make</b>
</pre>
This should work on any Unix-like system. If not, please report that as
a bug to me.  (Specific snapshots of mips64emul might have problems on
different platforms.)


<p><br>
<a name="use"></a>
<h4>How to use the emulator:</h4>

The emulator contains code which tries to emulate the workings of MIPS-like CPUs
and surrounding hardware found in real machines, but no actual MIPS ROM code or
MIPS program code.  You will need some form of program to run in the emulator.
<p>
You can use pre-compiled kernels (for example NetBSD or Linux), ROM images, or other programs
that are in MIPS binary format. A couple of different file formats are supported
(ELF, a.out, ECOFF, SREC, raw binaries).
<p>
As an example, let's say you want to emulate a Silicon Graphics O2 machine.
This machine type is also known as IP32, in the SGI namespace. Let's also
say that you want to run NetBSD on this emulated machine. A pre-compiled kernel
for NetBSD/sgimips can be found here:
<a href="http://ftp.sunet.se/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.6.2/sgimips/binary/kernel/netbsd-INSTALL.gz">
http://ftp.sunet.se/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.6.2/sgimips/binary/kernel/netbsd-INSTALL.gz</a>
<p>
Once you have downloaded the kernel and gunzip'd it, you can try it out in the
emulator like this:
<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -G32 -q netbsd-INSTALL</b>
</pre>
-G signifies that we want SGI emulation, and 32 is the SGI-specific machine type.
-q supresses debug messages. If everything works like it should, you should see NetBSD's boot messages...

</pre>
and after typing vt100 (or just pressing enter), you'll reach NetBSD's install program.
You will not be able to install anything though, as the AHC disk controller isn't
emulated yet.
<p>
To exit the emulator, type CTRL-C. By typing CTRL-B instead, a CTRL-C is sent to
the emulated program.
<p>
For some emulated machine types, a graphical framebuffer console is supported.
NetBSD/pmax (kernel found here: <a href="http://ftp.sunet.se/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.6.2/pmax/binary/kernel/netbsd-INSTALL.gz">
http://ftp.sunet.se/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.6.2/pmax/binary/kernel/netbsd-INSTALL.gz</a>)
running on an emulated DECstation 5000 supports this:
<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -D2 -X -Y2 -q -I1000000 -M12 netbsd-INSTALL</b>
</pre>
-D2 stands for DECstation, type 2; -X means to use X-windows to get a graphical
framebuffer; -Y2 is used to scale down the window by a factor 2x2; -q supresses
debug output; -I1000000 lets the emulated clock chip on DECstations have
a more realistic pace; and -M12 sets the amount of emulated memory to 12 MB.
The result should looks something like this:

<h4>How to install NetBSD/pmax inside the emulator</h4>

<font color="#ff0000">NOTE: This is still highly experimental and buggy,
and does not quite work yet!</font>
<p>
To run NetBSD/pmax in the emulator (on an emulated DECstation machine), 
you first need to install NetBSD onto a disk image. To NetBSD, the disk 
image looks and acts just like a real SCSI disk, but it is just a normal 
file in the host's filesystem.
<p>
You need to do the following:
<ol>
  <li>Compile mips64emul:<pre>
	$ <b>./configure; make</b>
</pre>
  <li>Download a NetBSD INSTALL kernel and gunzip it:<pre>
	<a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.6.2/pmax/binary/kernel/netbsd-INSTALL.gz">ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.6.2/pmax/binary/kernel/netbsd-INSTALL.gz</a>
</pre>
  <li>Download a NetBSD CD-ROM iso image: (approx. 75 MB)<pre>
	<a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/iso/1.6.2/pmaxcd.iso">ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/iso/1.6.2/pmaxcd.iso</a>
</pre>
  <li>Create an empty harddisk image, which will be the root disk
	that NetBSD installs itself onto:<pre>
	$ <b>dd if=/dev/zero of=netbsd_pmax_rootdisk.img bs=1 count=1 seek=680000000</b>
</pre>
  <li>Start the emulator with both the installation ISO image and the
	root disk image, and the kernel:<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -D2 -qN -XY2 -I1500000 -d pmaxcd.iso  \
		-d netbsd_pmax_rootdisk.img  netbsd-INSTALL</b>
</pre>
</ol>

<p>
Then proceed like you would if you would install NetBSD on a real
DECstation.  Even if the emulator is running on a very fast host system,
you should expect the installation to take quite some time.

<p>
Here are some screenshots taken during installation:

<p>
<font color="#ff0000">
TODO:  The last screenshot above shows where the installation bugs out.
gunzip says that the gzip data is invalid; perhaps the bug is
that some instruction used by gunzip is not 100% correctly emulated.
</font>

<p>
Once the installation is completed, following 
these steps should boot the OS from the root disk image:
<ol>
  <li>Download a NetBSD GENERIC kernel and gunzip it:<pre>
	<a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.6.2/pmax/binary/kernel/netbsd-GENERIC.gz">ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.6.2/pmax/binary/kernel/netbsd-GENERIC.gz</a>
</pre>
  <li>Start the emulator with the root disk image and the GENERIC kernel:<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -D2 -qN -XY2 -I1500000 -d netbsd_pmax_rootdisk.img netbsd-GENERIC</b>
</pre>
</ol>
<p>
<font color="#ff0000">
TODO:  As there are boot programs and kernels on both the CDROM image and 
on the harddisk image (after installation), it should not be neccessary to 
have separate kernels in addition to the CDROM/disk images.  It should be 
possible to boot right of the disk image.  As of right now, that
functionality has not been implemented.
</font>
<p>
Installing other OSes on other emulated machine types, when that becomes 
possible, might be done similar to the NetBSD/pmax installation described 
above.


<p><br>
<a name="cani"></a>
<h4>Can I run &lt;os-name&gt; in the emulator?</h4>

The answer is probably <i>no</i>, unless &lt;os-name&gt; is one of a few
things that I have tried myself. Under DECstation emulation, NetBSD,
Linux, and some Ultrix kernels work. Under SGI emulation, NetBSD and Linux
work a bit, but I've never gotten anything out of Irix except for a panic
message or two.
<p>
To sum it up: there is no guarantee that anything
specific will run in the emulator, but NetBSD (or possibly Linux) is a
good starting point for someone who wants to experiment. Linux kernels
don't usually have ramdisks in them, so until some disk controller device
has been implemented, NetBSD is the way to go if you want to reach
userland.
<p>
Also, the set of OSes that work is obviously very different for different 
emulation modes.


<p><br>
<a name="hello"></a>
<h4>Hello world:</h4>

You might want to use the emulator to develop programs on your own,
not just run precompiled kernels such as NetBSD. To get started, I'd recommend
you do two things:
<ul>
  <li>Build and install a cross-compiler for MIPS.
  <li>Compile this hello world program, and run it in the emulator.
</ul>
<p>
If the emulator is launched without specifying which machine to emulate,
it will emulate only a CPU and very few devices. One of those devices
is a console putchar() device, at a fixed address.
<pre>
	/*  Hello world for mips64emul  */

	#define	PUTCHAR_ADDRESS		0xb0000000

	void printchar(char ch)
	{
		*((volatile unsigned char *) PUTCHAR_ADDRESS) = ch;
	}

	void printstr(char *s)
	{
		while (*s)
			printchar(*s++);
	}

	void f(void)
	{
		printstr("Hello world\n");
		for (;;)
			;
	}
</pre>
This hello world program is available here as well: <a href="hello.c">hello.c</a>
<p>
I'd recommend you build a GCC cross compiler for the <b>mips64-unknown-elf</b>
target, and install it. Other compilers might work too, but GCC is good because
of its portability. Then try to compile the hello world program:
<pre>
	$ <b>mips64-unknown-elf-gcc hello.c -mips4 -mabi=64 -c</b>
	$ <b>mips64-unknown-elf-ld -Ttext 0x80030000 -e f hello.o -o hello --oformat=elf64-bigmips</b>
	$ <b>file hello</b>
	hello: ELF 64-bit MSB mips-4 executable, MIPS R3000_BE, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, not stripped
	$ <b>./mips64emul -q hello</b>
	Hello world

	$ <b>mips64-unknown-elf-gcc hello.c -c</b>
	$ <b>mips64-unknown-elf-ld -Ttext 0x80030000 -e f hello.o -o hello</b>
	$ <b>file hello</b>
	hello: ELF 32-bit MSB mips-3 executable, MIPS R3000_BE, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, not stripped
	$ <b>./mips64emul -q hello</b>
	Hello world
</pre>
As you can see above, a GCC configured for mips64-unknown-elf can produce
both 64-bit and 32-bit binaries.
<p>
Hopefully this is enough to get you inspired. :-)


<p><br>
<a name="portmips"></a>
<h4>Porting operating systems to MIPS using mips64emul:</h4>

Is this a good idea?  The answer is yes and no, depending on what you are
trying to port to. If you are developing an operating system or operating
system kernel of your own, and wish to target MIPS in general (that is,
the CPU but not hardware specific to any one machine type), then the
answer might be yes, for experimental purposes.
<p>
However, if you think that you can port an operating system
to, say, the Silicon Graphics machine mode of mips64emul and hope that your
operating system will run on a real SGI machine, then you will most
likely fail. mips64emul simply does not emulate things well enough for that to work.
A lot of the devices that are emulated are based on guesswork (for example,
by studying code in NetBSD that uses the device, and thereby figure
out more or less how the device is supposed to work).
<p>
In many cases, hardware devices in mips64emul are only implemented well
enough to fool eg. NetBSD that they are working correctly, while in fact
they don't work very much at all.  Please keep this in mind, if you plan
to use mips64emul when porting your code to MIPS.


<p><br>
<a name="disk"></a>
<h4>How to start the emulator with a disk image:</h4>

Add <i>-d diskimagefilename</i> to the command line. For example, if you
want to run a NetBSD/pmax kernel on an emulated DECstation machine, you
would use a command line such as this:
<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -D2 -q -d pmax_diskimage.fs netbsd-pmax-INSTALL</b>
</pre>
<p>
It is possible to have more than one disk. For each -d argument, a disk
image is added; the first will be SCSI target 0, the second will be target 1, and so on.
<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -D2 -q -d disk0.raw -d disk1.raw -d disk2.raw netbsd-pmax-INSTALL</b>
</pre>
If a filename has a "C:" prefix, or ends with ".iso", then it is treated 
as a CDROM device instead of a normal disk device. For example, the following
command would start the emulator with two CDROM images, and one harddisk image:
<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -D2 -q -d image.iso -d disk0.img -d C:second_cdrom.img netbsd-pmax-INSTALL</b>
</pre>


<p><br>
<a name="userland"></a>
<h4>Running userland binaries:</h4>

You can run (some) userland programs as well. This will not emulate any
particular machine, but instead try to translate syscalls from for example
NetBSD/pmax into the host's OS' syscalls. For example, running /bin/hostname
or /bin/date and similarly trivial programs from the NetBSD/pmax distribution
works:
<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -qu1 pmax_bin_hostname</b>
	tab.csbnet.se
	$ <b>./mips64emul -qu1 pmax_bin_date</b>
	Sun Jan 25 02:26:14 GMT 2004
	$ <b>./mips64emul -qu1 pmax_bin_sleep</b>
	usage: pmax_bin_sleep seconds
	$ <b>./mips64emul -qu1 pmax_bin_sleep 5</b>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -qu1 pmax_bin_sync</b>
</pre>
There's also an Ultrix4 emulation mode:
<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -qu2 ultrix4_bin_date</b>
	UNIMPLEMENTED ultrix syscall 54
	UNIMPLEMENTED ultrix syscall 62
	Mon Feb  9 12:50:59 WET 2004
	$ <b>./mips64emul -qu2 ultrix4_bin_hostname</b>
	tab.csbnet.se
</pre>
Userland syscall emulation is still in its beginning stages, so almost
nothing works.
<p>
Irix userland emulation might also be possible to add.


<p><br>
<a name="decrom"></a>
<h4>Using a PROM image from a DECstation:</h4>

<i>(The general ideas in this section applies to using ROM images from other machines as well.)</i>
<p>
Raw PROM images from real machines can, in a few cases, be used. One
case which I've tried is to use a DECstation 5000/125 PROM image.
ROM images from other machines might work as well, but ROM code is
usually much more sensitive to correctness of the emulator than
operating system kernels or userland programs are.
<p>
The image first needs to be extracted from the machine. I presume
that these PROMs are not legal to redistribute, so you really need
to extract the PROM from a physical machine that you own. There are
several ways to do this.
<ul>
  <li>Use hardware to read the PROM chip(s) directly. Not easy if you
	don't have such a hardware reader.
  <li>Copy the PROM memory range into a file, from a running
	operating system. You need a running OS, and it must
	have access to the PROM memory range. NetBSD, for example,
	doesn't allow that from userland.
  <li>Hook up a serial console and dump using the PROM's own dump
	command.
</ul>
<p>
The easiest way is to hook up a serial console. The terminal must be
able to capture output to a file.
<p>
These are approximately the commands that I used:
<pre>
        >><b>cnfg</b>                             <i>Show machine configuration</i>

        >><b>printenv</b>                         <i>Show environment variables</i>

        >><b>setenv more 0</b>                    <i>This turns off the More messages</i>

        >><b>e -x 0xbfc00000:0xbfffffff</b>       <i>Dump the PROM data</i>
</pre>
<p>
Remember that DECstations are little endian, so if the dump data
looks like this:
<pre>
        bfc00000:  0x0bf0007e
</pre>
then the bytes in memory are actually 0x7e, 0x00, 0xf0, and 0x0b.
<p>
At 9600 bps, about 10KB can be dumped per minute, so it takes a while.
Once enough of the PROM has been dumped, you can press CTRL-C to break out.
Then, restore the more environment variable:
<pre>
        >><b>setenv more 24</b>
</pre>
<p>
Now, convert the data you just saved (little-endian words -> bytes),
and store in a file. Let's call this file DECstation5000_125_promdump.bin.
<pre>
        $ <b>./decprom_dump_txt_to_bin DECstation5000_125_promdump.txt DECstation5000_125_promdump.bin</b>
</pre>
This binary image can now be used in the emulator:
<pre>

<i>(Note: at the moment, this doesn't work. I must have broken something when
fixing something else, but this is what it looked like at the time.)</i>
<p>
During bootup, the PROM complains <i>a lot</i> about hardware failures.
That's because the emulator doesn't emulate the hardware well enough yet.
<p>
The command line options used are:
-D3 for DECstation model 3 (5000/xxx), -Q to supress the emulator's own PROM
call emulation, -M128 for 128MB RAM (because mips64emul doesn't correctly
emulate memory detection well enough for the PROM to accept, so it will
always believe there is 128MB ram anyway), and -q to supress debug messages.
The 0xbfc00000 in front of the filename tells mips64emul that it is a raw
binary file which should be loaded at a specific virtual address.
