<h3>Overview:</h3>

mips64emul is a MIPS machine emulator.

The goals are to emulate 32-bit and 64-bit MIPS-like CPUs and enough surrounding hardware
to fake real machines, capable of running real (unmodified) operating systems,
such as <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a> or <a href="http://www.linux-mips.org/">Linux</a>.
This is a spare time hobby project, and many things are not implemented yet.
<p> 
The emulator could be of interest for academic research and experiments, such as
learning how to write an OS for a MIPS-based machine, or profiling SMP,
memory usage, or system call patterns.
<p>
The emulator is written in C, depends on no external libraries (except X11,
which is optional), and should compile and run on any Unix-like system. If it doesn't, that
is to be considered a bug. No MIPS compiler toolchain is needed if the program you
wish to run in the emulator is already in binary form. No ROM images are
needed, the emulator will try to emulate things such as PROM calls by
itself. However, if you have a ROM image, it might be possible to run it
in the emulator.

<h3>Is mips64emul free software?</h3>

Yes, mips64emul is distributed under a free license.
The code I have written is released under a 2-clause BSD-style license
(or "revised BSD-style" if one wants to use
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/bsd.html">GNU jargon</a>.)
<p>
Apart from the code I have written, some files are copied from other sources such
as NetBSD, for example header files containing symbolic names of bitfields in device
registers. They are also covered by similar licences, but with some additional
clauses. Please check individual files if you plan to reuse code from mips64emul.


<p><br>
<a name="emulmodes"></a>
<h3>Which machines does mips64emul emulate?</h3>

A few different machine types are emulated.
The machine types that are emulated best are:
<ul>
  <li>DECstation/DECsystem machines, made by Digital Equipment Corp.
  <li>Silicon Graphics MIPS-based machines
</ul>
<p>
At the moment, the only machine type emulated well enough to let an
operating system be installed onto a disk image is the DECstation.
<p>
Some other machine types are also emulated, but are not as close to
running an entire OS as the machine types above are.
<ul>
  <li>ARC (NEC RISCstation 2250 and 2200, Acer Pica-61, and Deskstation Tyne)
  <li>Cobalt
  <li>Sony Playstation 2
  <li>Handheld "hpcmips" devices
</ul>
<p>
Some more notes about the list above:  The machines above all have 64-bit
capable CPUs, except early DECstations models. There were upgrades from
R3000 to R4000 available for some DECstations, but I think Ultrix was still
running in 32-bit mode.  Unfortunately, even if most of these machine types have
64-bit CPUs in them (or even 128-bit, the Playstation 2's R5900 CPU
is a bit weird), operating systems often run in 32-bit mode on them.
<p>
There are other machines that use/used MIPS cpus, for example the
Playstation (1) and the Nintendo 64 game systems, but no free OS is ported
to those platforms as far as I know, so they might not be too interesting
to emulate.
<p>
Playstation 2 is among the emulated machine types, but the emulation done
by mips64emul is <i>not</i> suitable for playing games. Running Linux and
NetBSD is a lot more fun :-)
<p>
In addition to specific machine types, a "bare" machine can be emulated.
This mode is used when the emulator is started without specifying which
machine type to emulate.
A bare machine consists of one or more CPUs and a few experimental devices such
as:
<ul>
  <li>a console I/O device (think putchar() and getchar()...)
  <li>an inter-processor communication device, for SMP experiments
</ul>
This mode is useful if you wish to experiment with software for MIPS-like
systems, but do not with to target any specific real-world machine type.


<p><br>
<a name="build"></a>
<h3>How to compile/build the emulator:</h3>

Uncompress the .tar.gz file, and run
<pre>
	$ <b>./configure</b>
	$ <b>make</b>
</pre>
This should work on any Unix-like system. If not, please report that as
a bug to me.  (Specific snapshots of mips64emul might have problems on
different platforms.)
<p>
The emulator's performance is highly dependant on both runtime settings
and on compiler settings, so you might want to experiment with different
CC and CFLAGS environment variable values.
<p>
Here's a list of available configure options:
<pre>
    --caches    enable cache emulation
    --delays    enable instruction latency/delay emulation
    --mips16    enable MIPS16 instruction support
    --nox11     configure without x11 support
</pre>
<p>
--caches causes an overall slowdown for R3000, but hopefully not for
the others yet. Enabling caches does <i>not</i> by itself mean correct
cache miss penalties and such (you need both --caches and --delays for that)
but it is needed to fool some operating system kernels (eg Mach/pmax)
that the cache works like it should.
<p>
--delays simulates instruction latencies. Memory accesses can have penalties.
When combined with --caches, cache misses cause penalties as well.
<p>
--mips16 enables the almost non-existant MIPS16 support.
<p>
--nox11 disables X11 support completely. (If the configure script cannot
compile a small X11 test program, it will be disabled anyway.)
<p>
(The possible configure options might differ between different releaes and
snapshots, so this list may be incomplete.)

<h3>Which guest OSes are possible to run?</h3>

This table sums up the guest OSes that run well enough to be considered
"working" in the emulator, that is, they can be installed onto some kind
of harddisk image and be interacted with similar to a real machine:
<p>
  <table border="1">
    <tr>
      <td><b>Emulation mode:</b></td>
      <td><b>Guest OS:</b></td>
      <td><b>Suitable command line arguments:</b></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>DECstation</td>
      <td>NetBSD/pmax</td>
      <td>-D2 -I5000000 -d rootdisk_name name_of_netbsd_pmax_kernel
	<br>(add -NX for graphical framebuffer)
	</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>DECstation</td>
      <td>Ultrix/pmax</td>
      <td>-j -D2 -I5000000 -d rootdisk_name name_of_ultrix_kernel
	<br>(add -NX for graphical framebuffer)
	</td>
    </tr>

  </table>
<p>
Some other emulation modes, most notably SGI emulation modes,
work relatively well with NetBSD, but not well enough
to support SCSI disk images, and definitely not well enough to run Irix.
<p>
It is non-trivial to get a specific operating system or OS kernel to
run in the emulator, so don't expect the list above to grow very quickly.
<p>
There is no guarantee that anything
specific will run in the emulator, but NetBSD (or possibly Linux) is a
good starting point for someone who wants to experiment. Linux kernels
don't usually have ramdisks in them, so until some disk controller device
has been implemented, NetBSD is the way to go if you want to reach
userland.


<p><br>
<a name="use"></a>
<h3>How to use the emulator:</h3>

The emulator contains code which tries to emulate the workings of MIPS-like CPUs
and surrounding hardware found in real machines, but no actual MIPS ROM code or
MIPS program code.  You will need some form of program to run in the emulator.
<p>
You can use pre-compiled kernels (for example NetBSD or Linux), ROM images, or other programs
that are in MIPS binary format. A couple of different file formats are supported
(ELF, a.out, ECOFF, SREC, raw binaries).
<p>
As an example, let's say you want to emulate a Silicon Graphics O2 machine.
This machine type is also known as IP32, in the SGI namespace. Let's also
say that you want to run NetBSD on this emulated machine. A pre-compiled kernel
for NetBSD/sgimips can be found here:
<a href="http://ftp.sunet.se/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.6.2/sgimips/binary/kernel/netbsd-INSTALL.gz">
http://ftp.sunet.se/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.6.2/sgimips/binary/kernel/netbsd-INSTALL.gz</a>
<p>
Once you have downloaded the kernel and gunzip'd it, you can try it out in the
emulator like this:
<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -G32 -CR5000 -q netbsd-INSTALL</b>
</pre>
-G signifies that we want SGI emulation, and 32 is the SGI-specific machine type.
-q supresses debug messages. If everything works like it should, you should see NetBSD's boot messages...

</pre>
and after typing vt100 (or just pressing enter), you'll reach NetBSD's install program.
You will not be able to install anything though, as the AHC disk controller isn't
emulated yet.
<p>
To exit the emulator, type CTRL-C. By typing CTRL-B instead, a CTRL-C is sent to
the emulated program.
<p>
For some emulated machine types, a graphical framebuffer console is supported.
NetBSD/pmax (kernel found here: <a href="http://ftp.sunet.se/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.6.2/pmax/binary/kernel/netbsd-INSTALL.gz">
http://ftp.sunet.se/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.6.2/pmax/binary/kernel/netbsd-INSTALL.gz</a>)
running on an emulated DECstation 5000 supports this:
<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -D2 -X -Y2 -I4000000 -M12 netbsd-INSTALL</b>
</pre>
-D2 stands for DECstation, type 2; -X means to use X-windows to get a graphical
framebuffer; -Y2 is used to scale down the window by a factor 2x2;
-I4000000 lets the emulated clock chip on DECstations have
a more realistic pace; and -M12 sets the amount of emulated memory to 12 MB.
The result should looks something like this:

<h3>How to install NetBSD/pmax inside the emulator</h3>

To run NetBSD/pmax in the emulator (on an emulated DECstation machine), 
you first need to install NetBSD onto a disk image. To NetBSD, the disk 
image looks and acts like a real SCSI disk, but it is just a normal 
file in the host's filesystem.
<p>
You need to do the following:
<ol>
  <li>Compile mips64emul:<pre>
	$ <b>./configure; make</b>

</pre>
  <li>Download a NetBSD CD-ROM iso image: (approx. 75 MB)<pre>
	<a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/iso/1.6.2/pmaxcd.iso">ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/iso/1.6.2/pmaxcd.iso</a>

</pre>
  <li>Create an empty harddisk image, which will be the root disk
	that NetBSD installs itself onto:<pre>
	$ <b>dd if=/dev/zero of=netbsddisk.img bs=1 count=512 seek=900000000</b>

</pre>
  <li>Start the emulator like this:<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -D2 -N -X -I4000000 -d netbsddisk.img -d bc:pmaxcd.iso -j netbsd.pmax</b>
</pre>
	Alternatively, if you don't want to use a graphical framebuffer:<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -D2 -I4000000 -d netbsddisk.img -d bc:pmaxcd.iso -j netbsd.pmax</b>
</pre>
	but then make sure you choose 'vt100' when prompted with which terminal
	type to use, and not 'rcons'.
</ol>

<p>
Then proceed like you would do if you were installing NetBSD on a real
DECstation.  Even if the emulator is running on a very fast host system,
you should expect the installation to take quite some time. On a
2.8 GHz Xeon-based PC, a full install takes approximately an hour.

<p>
When the installation is completed, the following command should start
NetBSD from the harddisk image:<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -D2 -N -X -I4000000 -d netbsddisk.img</b>
</pre>
<p>
If you want to run without the X framebuffer, use this instead:<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -D2 -I4000000 -d netbsddisk.img</b>
</pre>

<p>
These installation instructions can be used for Ultrix as well,
but then <b>-j vmunix</b> must be used, both during install and during

<h3>Hello world:</h3>

You might want to use the emulator to develop programs on your own,
not just run precompiled kernels such as NetBSD. To get started, I'd recommend
you do two things:
<ul>
  <li>Build and install a cross-compiler for MIPS.
  <li>Compile this hello world program, and run it in the emulator.
</ul>
<p>
If the emulator is launched without specifying which machine to emulate,
it will emulate only a CPU and very few devices. One of those devices
is a console putchar() device, at a fixed address.
<pre>
	/*  Hello world for mips64emul  */

	#define	PUTCHAR_ADDRESS		0xb0000000

	void printchar(char ch)
	{
		*((volatile unsigned char *) PUTCHAR_ADDRESS) = ch;
	}

	void printstr(char *s)
	{
		while (*s)
			printchar(*s++);
	}

	void f(void)
	{
		printstr("Hello world\n");
		for (;;)
			;
	}
</pre>
This hello world program is available here as well: <a href="hello.c">hello.c</a>
<p>
I'd recommend you build a GCC cross compiler for the <b>mips64-unknown-elf</b>
target, and install it. Other compilers might work too, but GCC is good because
of its portability. Then try to compile the hello world program:
<pre>
	$ <b>mips64-unknown-elf-gcc hello.c -mips4 -mabi=64 -c</b>
	$ <b>mips64-unknown-elf-ld -Ttext 0x80030000 -e f hello.o -o hello --oformat=elf64-bigmips</b>
	$ <b>file hello</b>
	hello: ELF 64-bit MSB mips-4 executable, MIPS R3000_BE, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, not stripped
	$ <b>./mips64emul -q hello</b>
	Hello world

	$ <b>mips64-unknown-elf-gcc hello.c -c</b>
	$ <b>mips64-unknown-elf-ld -Ttext 0x80030000 -e f hello.o -o hello</b>
	$ <b>file hello</b>
	hello: ELF 32-bit MSB mips-3 executable, MIPS R3000_BE, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, not stripped
	$ <b>./mips64emul -q hello</b>
	Hello world
</pre>
As you can see above, a GCC configured for mips64-unknown-elf can produce
both 64-bit and 32-bit binaries.
<p>
Hopefully this is enough to get you inspired. :-)

<h3>Porting operating systems to MIPS using mips64emul:</h3>

Is this a good idea?  The answer is yes and no, depending on what you are
trying to port to. If you are developing an operating system or operating
system kernel of your own, and wish to target MIPS-like systems in general,
then the answer might be yes, for experimental purposes.
<p>
However, if you think that you can port an operating system
to, say, the Silicon Graphics machine mode of mips64emul and hope that your
operating system will run on a real SGI machine, then you will most
likely fail. mips64emul simply does not emulate things well enough for that to work.
Another example would be specific CPU details; if your code depends on,
say, R10000 specifics, chances are that mips64emul will not be sufficient.
<p>
In many cases, hardware devices in mips64emul are only implemented well
enough to fool for example NetBSD that they are working correctly, while in fact
they don't work very much at all.  Please keep this in mind, if you plan
to use mips64emul when porting your code to MIPS.


<p><br>
<a name="disk"></a>
<h3>How to start the emulator with a disk image:</h3>

Add <i>-d [prefixes:]diskimagefilename</i> to the command line, where prefixes
are one or more single-character options. Run mips64emul with no command line
arguments to get a list of possible options.
<p>
Here are some examples. If you want to run a NetBSD/pmax kernel on an
emulated DECstation machine, you would use a command line such as this:
<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -D2 -d pmax_diskimage.fs netbsd-pmax-INSTALL</b>
</pre>
<p>
It is possible to have more than one disk. For each -d argument, a disk
image is added; the first will be SCSI target 0, the second will be target 1, and so on,
unless you specify explicitly which ID number the devices should have.
<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -D2 -d disk0.raw -d disk1.raw -d 5:disk2.raw netbsd-pmax-INSTALL</b>
</pre>
Note: In the example above, disk2.raw will get scsi id 5.
</p>
If a filename has a 'c' prefix, or ends with ".iso", then it is assumed to be
a CDROM device (this can be overridden with a 'd' prefix, to force a read/write disk).
For example, the following command would start the emulator with two
CDROM images, and one harddisk image:
<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -D2 -d image.iso -d disk0.img -d C:second_cdrom.img netbsd-pmax-INSTALL</b>
</pre>
Usually, the device with the lowest id becomes the boot device. To override
this, add a 'b' prefix to one of the devices:
<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -D2 -d rootdisk.img -d bc:install-cd.iso name_of_kernel</b>
</pre>
If you have a physical CD-ROM drive on the host machine, say /dev/cd0c, you can
use it as a CD-ROM directly accessible from within the emulator:
<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -D2 -d rootdisk.img -d bc:/dev/cd0c name_of_kernel</b>
</pre>
It is probably possible to use harddisks as well this way, but I would not
recommend it.
<p>
Using emulated tape drives is a bit more complicated than disks, because a
tape can be made up of several "files" with space in between. The solution
I have choosen is to have one file in the host's file system space for each
tape file. The prefix for using tapes is 't', and the filename given is
for the <i>first</i> file on that tape (number zero, implicitly). For
files following file nr 0, a dot and the filenumber is appended to the
filename.
<p>
As an example, starting the emulator with
<pre>
	<b>-d t4:mytape.img</b>
</pre>
will cause SCSI id 4 to be a tape device, using the following file number
to name translation scheme:
<p>
<center>
 <table border="0">
  <tr>
    <td><b>File number:</b></td>
    <td><b>File name in the host's filesystem:</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">0</td>
    <td align="left">mytape.img</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">1</td>
    <td align="left">mytape.img.1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">2</td>
    <td align="left">mytape.img.2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">..</td>
    <td align="left">..</td>
  </tr>
 </table>
</center>
<p>
If you already have a number of tape files, which should be placed on the
same emulated tape, then you might not want to rename all those files.
Use symbolic links instead (ln -s).
<p>
There is another advantage to using symbolic links for tape filenames:
every time a tape is rewound, it is reopened using the filename given
on the command line. By changing what the symbolic name points to,
you can "switch tapes" without quiting and restarting the emulator.


<p><br>
<a name="userland"></a>
<h3>Running userland binaries:</h3>

You can run (some) userland programs as well. This will not emulate any
particular machine, but instead try to translate syscalls from for example
NetBSD/pmax into the host's OS' syscalls. For example, running /bin/hostname
or /bin/date and similarly trivial programs from the NetBSD/pmax distribution
works:
<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -qu1 pmax_bin_hostname</b>
	tab.csbnet.se
	$ <b>./mips64emul -qu1 pmax_bin_date</b>
	Sun Jan 25 02:26:14 GMT 2004
	$ <b>./mips64emul -qu1 pmax_bin_sleep</b>
	usage: pmax_bin_sleep seconds
	$ <b>./mips64emul -qu1 pmax_bin_sleep 5</b>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -qu1 pmax_bin_sync</b>
</pre>
There's also an Ultrix4 emulation mode:
<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -qu2 ultrix4_bin_date</b>
	UNIMPLEMENTED ultrix syscall 54
	UNIMPLEMENTED ultrix syscall 62
	Mon Feb  9 12:50:59 WET 2004
	$ <b>./mips64emul -qu2 ultrix4_bin_hostname</b>
	tab.csbnet.se
</pre>
Userland syscall emulation is still in its beginning stages, so almost
nothing works.
<p>
Irix userland emulation might also be possible to add.

<h3>Using a PROM image from a DECstation:</h3>

<i>(The general ideas in this section applies to using ROM images from other machines as well.)</i>
<p>
Raw PROM images from real machines can, in a few cases, be used. One
case which I've tried is to use a DECstation 5000/125 PROM image.
ROM images from other machines might work as well, but ROM code is
usually much more sensitive to correctness of the emulator than
operating system kernels or userland programs are.
<p>
The image first needs to be extracted from the machine. I presume
that these PROMs are not legal to redistribute, so you really need
to extract the PROM from a physical machine that you own. There are
several ways to do this.
<ul>
  <li>Use hardware to read the PROM chip(s) directly. Not easy if you
	don't have such a hardware reader.
  <li>Copy the PROM memory range into a file, from a running
	operating system. You need a running OS, and it must
	have access to the PROM memory range. NetBSD, for example,
	doesn't allow that from userland.
  <li>Hook up a serial console and dump using the PROM's own dump
	command.
</ul>
<p>
The easiest way is to hook up a serial console. The terminal must be
able to capture output to a file.
<p>
These are approximately the commands that I used:
<pre>
        >><b>cnfg</b>                             <i>Show machine configuration</i>

        >><b>printenv</b>                         <i>Show environment variables</i>

        >><b>setenv more 0</b>                    <i>This turns off the More messages</i>

        >><b>e -x 0xbfc00000:0xbfffffff</b>       <i>Dump the PROM data</i>
</pre>
<p>
Remember that DECstations are little endian, so if the dump data
looks like this:
<pre>
        bfc00000:  0x0bf0007e
</pre>
then the bytes in memory are actually 0x7e, 0x00, 0xf0, and 0x0b.
<p>
At 9600 bps, about 10KB can be dumped per minute, so it takes a while.
Once enough of the PROM has been dumped, you can press CTRL-C to break out.
Then, restore the more environment variable:
<pre>
        >><b>setenv more 24</b>
</pre>
<p>
Now, convert the data you just saved (little-endian words -> bytes),
and store in a file. Let's call this file DECstation5000_125_promdump.bin.
<pre>
        $ <b>./decprom_dump_txt_to_bin DECstation5000_125_promdump.txt DECstation5000_125_promdump.bin</b>
</pre>
This binary image can now be used in the emulator:
<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -D3 -Q -M128 -q 0xbfc00000:DECstation5000_125_promdump.bin</b>

	KN02-BA V5.7e   
	?TFL:  3/scc/access (1:Ln1 reg-12: actual=0x00 xpctd=0x01) [KN02-BA]

	>><b>printenv</b>
	 boot=

	 haltaction=h

	 osconsole=3
	>>
</pre>
<i>(Note: at the moment, this doesn't work. I must have broken something when
fixing something else, but this is what it looked like at the time.)</i>
<p>
During bootup, the PROM complains <i>a lot</i> about hardware failures.
That's because the emulator doesn't emulate the hardware well enough yet.
<p>
The command line options used are:
-D3 for DECstation model 3 (5000/xxx), -Q to supress the emulator's own PROM
call emulation, -M128 for 128MB RAM (because mips64emul doesn't correctly
emulate memory detection well enough for the PROM to accept, so it will
always believe there is 128MB ram anyway), and -q to supress debug messages.
The 0xbfc00000 in front of the filename tells mips64emul that it is a raw
binary file which should be loaded at a specific virtual address.
