<h3>Overview:</h3>

mips64emul is a free MIPS machine emulator. The goals are to emulate
MIPS-like CPUs and enough surrounding hardware to let unmodified operating
systems run as if they were running on a real machine, and to assist in
experiments involving MIPS-like code in general.   

<p>
It is important to keep in mind that devices and CPUs are not really emulated
correctly, they are only "faked" well enough to make eg. NetBSD run.
That said, the emulator could still be of interest for academic research
and experiments, such as learning how to write an OS for a MIPS-like
machine, or profiling SMP, memory usage, or system call patterns.

<p>
The emulator is written in C, depends on no external libraries (except X11,
which is optional), and should compile and run on any Unix-like system. If
it doesn't, that is to be considered a bug.

<p>
The emulator contains code which tries to emulate the workings of MIPS-like
CPUs and surrounding hardware found in real machines, but it does not 
contain any actual MIPS ROM code or other form of MIPS program code.  You 
will need some form of program (in binary form) to run in the emulator.
For many emulation modes, PROM calls are handled by the emulator itself, 
so you do not need to use any PROM image at all.

<p>
You can use pre-compiled kernels (for example NetBSD kernels, or
Linux), or other programs that are in MIPS binary format, and in some
cases even actual ROM images. A couple of different file formats are
supported (ELF, a.out, ECOFF, SREC, raw binaries).

<p>
You do not need any MIPS compiler toolchain to build or use mips64emul.
If you need to compile MIPS binaries from sources, then of course you need 
such a toolchain, but that is completely separate from mips64emul. (There
is also a <a href="technical.html#regtest">regression testing</a> framework,
which requires that a GNU CC for mips64-unknown-elf or similar is available,
but it is not required to build the emulator.)

<p>
(MIPS is a registered trademark of MIPS Technologies. mips64emul is 
developed as a spare-time hobby, and there is no affiliation with MIPS 
Technologies in any way whatsoever.)



<p><br>
<a name="free"></a>
<h3>Is mips64emul free software?</h3>

Yes. mips64emul is distributed under a free license.
(For a definitions of the four freedoms associated with free software,
please read <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html</a>.)

<p>
The code I have written is released under a 3-clause BSD-style license
(or "revised BSD-style" if one wants to use
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/bsd.html">GNU jargon</a>.)
Apart from the code I have written, some files are copied from other sources
such as NetBSD, for example header files containing symbolic names of
bitfields in device registers. They are also covered by similar licenses,
but with some additional clauses. If you plan to redistribute mips64emul
(for example as a binary package), or reuse code from mips64emul,
then you should check those files for their license terms.

<p>
(The licenses usually require that the original Copyright and license 
terms are included when you make a copy or modification. The "easiest way 
out" if you plan to redistribute code from mips64emul is to simply supply 
the source code. You should however check individual files for details.)





<p><br>
<a name="build"></a>
<h3>How to compile/build the emulator:</h3>

Uncompress the .tar.gz distribution file, and run
<pre>
	$ <b>./configure</b>
	$ <b>make</b>
</pre>

<p>
This should work on any Unix-like system. If it doesn't, then please mail me a
bug report.

<p>
(Note for Windows users: there is a small possibility that this will also
work under Cygwin, but this is totally unsupported, as I have no such system
to try it on.)

<p>
The emulator's performance is highly dependent on both runtime settings
and on compiler settings, so you might want to experiment with different
CC and CFLAGS environment variable values. For example, on a modern PC, 
you could try the following:
<p>
<pre>
        $ <b>CFLAGS="-mcpu=pentium4 -O3" ./configure</b>
        $ <b>make</b>
</pre>

<p>
A number of different configure options are available:
<pre>
        <i>--caches</i>       enable cache emulation
        <i>--delays</i>       enable instruction latency/delay emulation
        <i>--mips16</i>       enable MIPS16 instruction support
        <i>--nobintrans</i>   configure without bintrans support, even if the host supports it
        <i>--nox11</i>        configure without X11 support
        <i>--userland</i>     enable userland emulation
</pre>

<p>
<i>--caches</i> enables emulation of caches (R3000 only, so far). This causes an 
overall slowdown, so don't enable it unless you need it. Enabling caches
does <i>not</i> by itself mean correct cache miss penalties and such (you
need both <i>--caches</i> and <i>--delays</i> for that) but it is needed to fool some
operating system kernels (eg Mach/pmax) that the cache works like it should.
<p>
<i>--delays</i> simulates instruction latencies. Memory accesses can have penalties.
When combined with <i>--caches</i>, cache misses cause penalties as well. This 
causes an overall slowdown, so don't enable it unless you need it.
<p>
<i>--mips16</i> enables MIPS16 instruction support. This doesn't really work yet, 
as only very few MIPS16 instructions are translated. This causes an overall
slowdown, so don't enable it unless you need it.
<p>
<i>--nobintrans</i> disables dynamic binary translation completely.
<p>
<i>--nox11</i> disables X11 support completely. (If the configure script cannot
compile a small X11 test program, it will be disabled anyway.)  This might 
improve performance slightly, but makes it impossible to run certain 
things in the emulator.
<p>
<i>--userland</i> enables userland emulation support. This is experimental, only a 
few syscalls are implemented, mostly as a proof-of-concept. This might 
cause a tiny slowdown, so don't enable it unless you need it.

<p>
The possible configure options might differ between different releases and
snapshots, so this list may be incomplete.

<p>
Once you have built mips64emul, running it should be rather 
straight-forward. To exit the emulator, type CTRL-C to enter the 
single-step debugger, and then type <b>quit</b>. By typing CTRL-B instead,
a CTRL-C is sent to the emulated program.






<p><br>
<a name="emulmodes"></a>
<h3>Which machines does mips64emul emulate?</h3>

A few different machine types are emulated.
The machine types that are emulated best at the moment are:
<ul>
  <li><b>DECstation/DECsystem machines</b>
	<br>Model 5000/200: Serial controller (including keyboard and
		mouse), ethernet, SCSI, and graphical framebuffers are
		emulated.
	<br>Other models: these differ slightly from the 5000/200 model,
		and mips64emul doesn't emulate them well enough to run
		a complete OS yet.
  <p>
  <li><b>Acer Pica-61</b> (an ARC machine)
	<br>Serial controller, "VGA" text console, and SCSI are emulated
		well enough to let NetBSD/arc and OpenBSD/arc be installed
		and run.
</ul>

<p>
There is code in mips64emul for emulation of many other machine types;
the degree to which these work range from "almost" being able to run
a complete OS, to almost completely unsupported (perhaps just enough
support to output a few boot messages via serial console).

<p>
In addition to specific machine types, a "bare" machine can be emulated.
A bare machine consists of one or more CPUs and a few experimental 
devices such as:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>a console I/O device (putchar() and getchar()...)
  <li>an inter-processor communication device, for SMP experiments
</ul>
<p>
This mode is useful if you wish to experiment with software for MIPS-like
systems, but do not with to target any specific real-world machine type, 
for example for educational purposes or generic MIPS related experiments.





<p><br>
<a name="cpus"></a>
<h3>Which CPU types does mips64emul emulate?</h3>

While other emulators aim to emulate only one specific CPU type, eg R3000,
mips64emul does not. The ideal goal would be to emulate "all" MIPS-like CPUs.

<p>
Both 64-bit and 32-bit MIPS-like CPUs can be emulated. mips64emul is
basically an instruction-level simulator; things that would happen in 
several steps within a physical CPU are not necessarily simulated 
correctly or at all (eg. pipe-line stages).

<p>
Emulation of R4000, which is a 64-bit CPU, was my initial goal. Right
now, R2000/R3000-like CPUs are also emulated (32-bit), and emulation of
R1x000 (at least the parts that are similar to R4000) is beginning to work
as expected. Code targeted for MIPS32 and MIPS64 also happens to work, as
long as no specific features of MIPS32/64 are used that didn't exist in
R4000 etc.

<p>
I have written an experimental dynamic binary translation subsystem.  
This gives higher total performance than interpreting one instruction at a
time and executing it. However, even with the binary translation 
activated, mips64emul is not nearly as fast as some of the other emulators 
out there that have speed as their number one priority.
(If you wish to enable bintrans, add <b>-b</b> to the
command line, but keep in mind that it is still experimental.)

<h3>Which guest OSes are possible to run?</h3>

This table sums up the guest OSes that run well enough to be considered
working in the emulator. They can boot from a harddisk image and be
interacted with similar to a real machine:

<super>*</super> Although Linux runs under DECstation emulation, at the
time of writing this Linux has no support for keyboards on the 5000/200
(the specific DECstation model being emulated), so when the login prompt
is reached you cannot interact with the system. Some people are
<a href="http://meeting.ffis.de/Oldenburg2004/work.html">working on</a>
improving the situation. Running in text-mode (emulated serial console) 
works fine, though, but then you don't get to see the penguin in the corner.

<p>
It is non-trivial to get a specific operating system or OS kernel to
run in the emulator, so don't expect the list above to grow too quickly.

<p>
There is no guarantee that anything specific will run in the emulator, but
NetBSD is a good starting point for someone who wants to experiment.





<p><br>
<a name="netbsdinstall"></a>
<h3>How to install NetBSD/pmax in the emulator:</h3>

To run NetBSD/pmax in the emulator (on an emulated DECstation machine), 
you first need to install NetBSD onto a disk image. To NetBSD, the disk 
image looks and acts like a real SCSI disk, but it is just a normal 
file in the host's filesystem.

<p>
I've done most of the testing with NetBSD 1.6.2, but the following 
instructions should hopefully work for NetBSD 2.0 as well.

<p>
You need to do the following:
<ol start="1">
  <li>Compile mips64emul:<pre>
	$ <b>./configure; make</b>

</pre>
  <li>Create an empty harddisk image, which will be the root disk
	that NetBSD installs itself onto:<pre>
	$ <b>dd if=/dev/zero of=netbsddisk.img bs=1 count=512 seek=1900000000</b>

</pre>
</ol>
<p>
From this point, there are two separate ways to continue the installation.
You can either download a CD-ROM iso image (and let the installation 
program copy files from the CD-ROM image to the harddisk image), or you 
can install via ftp. For an installation from a CD-ROM image, follow these 
steps:
<p>
<ol start="3">

  <li>Download a NetBSD CD-ROM iso image:<pre>
	<a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/iso/1.6.2/pmaxcd.iso">ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/iso/1.6.2/pmaxcd.iso</a>
	or
	<a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/iso/2.0/pmaxcd.iso">ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/iso/2.0/pmaxcd.iso</a>

</pre>
  <li>Start the emulator like this:<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -X -b -D2 -d netbsddisk.img -d bc:pmaxcd.iso</b>
</pre>
</ol>
<p>
For an ftp install, substitute steps 3 and 4 above with these:
<p>
<ol start="3">

  <li>Download a NetBSD pmax INSTALL kernel (1.3 MB), and gunzip it:<pre>
	<a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.6.2/pmax/binary/kernel/netbsd-INSTALL.gz">ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.6.2/pmax/binary/kernel/netbsd-INSTALL.gz</a>
	or
	<a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-2.0/pmax/binary/kernel/netbsd-INSTALL.gz">ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-2.0/pmax/binary/kernel/netbsd-INSTALL.gz</a>

	$ <b>gunzip netbsd-INSTALL.gz</b>

</pre>
  <li>Start the emulator like this:<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -X -b -D2 -d netbsddisk.img -O netbsd-INSTALL</b>
</pre>
</ol>

<p>
(If you don't want to use a graphical framebuffer during the install,
you can remove <b>-X</b> from the command line, but then make sure you
choose 'vt100' when prompted with which terminal type to use, and not
'rcons'.)

<p>
Then proceed like you would do if you were installing NetBSD on a real
DECstation.  Even if the emulator is running on a very fast host system,
you should expect the installation to take quite some time.
If you are installing from the network, then suitable networking 
parameters are as follows:<pre>
	Which device shall I use? [le0]: <b>le0</b>
	..
	Your DNS domain: <b>mydomain.com</b>
	Your host name: <b>foo</b>
	Your IPv4 number: <b>10.0.0.1</b>
	IPv4 Netmask [0xff000000]: <b>0xff000000</b>
	IPv4 gateway: <b>10.0.0.254</b>
	IPv4 name server: <b>10.0.0.254</b>
</pre>

<p>
(If using 10.0.0.254 as the nameserver fails, then try entering the
IP number of a real-world nameserver instead.)

<p>
When the installation is completed, the following command should start
NetBSD from the harddisk image:<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -X -b -M64 -D2 -d netbsddisk.img</b>
</pre>

<p>
Use <b>startx</b> to start X windows.

<p>
<font color="#ff0000">NOTE:</font> For some reason, NetBSD 2.0 doesn't
work with X out-of-the-box on pmax. It seems that this has to do with a 
switch to WSCONS. For now, if you want X, then try NetBSD 1.6.2.

<p>
If you want to run without the X framebuffer, use this instead:<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -D2 -b -d netbsddisk.img</b>
</pre>

<p>
NetBSD/pmax seems to work fine with dynamic binary translation (enabled 
by the <b>-b</b> command line option) in R3000 mode. NetBSD also
supports R4000-like CPUs on pmax, but the bintrans support for R4000 in
the emulator is less stable than for R3000.

  <li>From now on, you have to use your imagination, as there is no
	automatic installation program for NetBSD/arc. Here are some tips
	and hints on how you can proceed with the install:<pre>
	$ <b>mount /dev/cd0a /mnt2</b>
	$ <b>disklabel -i -I sd0</b>    (for example 'a', '4.2BSD', '1c',
	    '600M', 'b', 'swap', '601M', '$', 'P', 'W', 'y', and 'Q')
	$ <b>newfs /dev/sd0a</b>
	$ <b>mount /dev/sd0a /mnt</b>
	$ <b>cd /mnt</b>
	$ <b>for a in /mnt2/arc/binary/sets/*.tgz; do tar xvzpf $a; done</b>
	$ <b>cd dev; sh MAKEDEV all</b>
	$ <b>cd ../etc; echo "rc_configured=YES" &gt;&gt; rc.conf</b>
	$ <b>cat > /mnt/etc/fstab</b>
	    /dev/sd0a / ffs rw 1 1
	    /dev/sd0b none swap sw 0 0
	    (ctrl-d)
	$ <b>cd /; umount /mnt; umount /mnt2</b>
	$ <b>halt</b>

</pre>
  <li>Download a generic NetBSD/arc kernel,
	and gunzip it:<pre>
	<a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.6.2/arc/binary/kernel/netbsd-GENERIC.gz">ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.6.2/arc/binary/kernel/netbsd-GENERIC.gz</a>

</pre>
</ol>

<p>
You can now use the generic NetBSD/arc kernel to boot from the harddisk 
image, using the following command:
<p>
<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -A2 -d nbsd_arc.img netbsd-GENERIC</b>

<h3>How to install OpenBSD/pmax in the emulator:</h3>

Installing OpenBSD/pmax is a bit harder than installing NetBSD/pmax.
You should first read the section above on how to install NetBSD,
before continuing here. If you have never installed OpenBSD on any
architecture, then you need a great deal of patience to do this.
If, on the other hand you are used to installing OpenBSD, then
this should be no problem for you.

<p>
OpenBSD/pmax died at release 2.8 of OpenBSD, so you should be
aware of the fact that this will not give you an up-to-date OpenBSD
system. The files are available at this URL:
<pre>
	<a href="ftp://ftp.se.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/2.8/pmax/">ftp://ftp.se.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/2.8/pmax/</a>
</pre>

<p>
Following these instructions <i>might</i> work. If not, then use
common sense and imagination to modify them as you see fit.

<p>
<ol>
  <li>Compile mips64emul:<pre>
	$ <b>./configure; make</b>

</pre>
  <li>Create an empty harddisk image, which will be the root disk
	that OpenBSD installs itself onto:<pre>
	$ <b>dd if=/dev/zero of=openbsddisk.img bs=1 count=512 seek=900000000</b>

</pre>
  <li>Download the entire pmax directory from the ftp server: (approx. 99 MB)<pre>
	$ <b>wget -r ftp://ftp.se.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/2.8/pmax/</b>

</pre>

  <li>Execute the following commands:<pre>
	$ <b>mv ftp.se.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/2.8/pmax/simpleroot28.fs.gz .</b>
	$ <b>gunzip simpleroot28.fs.gz</b>
	$ <b>chmod +w simpleroot28.fs</b>		&lt;--- make sure

</pre>
  <li>You now need to make an ISO image of the entire directory you downloaded.
	I recommend using <b>mkisofs</b> for that purpose. If you don't already
	have mkisofs installed on your system, you need to install that in
	order to do this.<pre>
	$ <b>mkisofs -o openbsd_pmax_2.8.iso ftp.se.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/2.8/pmax</b>

</pre>
  <li>Start the emulator with all three (!) disk images:<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -D2 -b -d openbsddisk.img -d b:simpleroot28.fs -j bsd -d c:openbsd_pmax_2.8.iso</b>

</pre>
	(If you add -X, you will run with the graphical framebuffer. This is <i>REALLY</i> slow
	because the console has to scroll a lot during the install. I don't recommend it.)
  <p>
  <li>Go on with the installation as you would do if you were installing on a real machine.
	If you are not used to the OpenBSD installer, then this will most likely
	be a very uncomfortable experience. Some important things to keep in mind are:
	<ul>
	  <li>rz0 is the rootdisk you wish to install onto.
	  <li>rz1 is the simpleroot image.
	  <li>rz2 is the CDROM containing the "install sets".
	  <li>When asked for the "<b>root device?</b>", enter <b>rz1</b>.
	  <li>At "<b>Enter pathname of shell or RETURN for sh:</b>", press enter.
	  <li>At the # prompt, do the following:<pre>
	$ <b>fsck /dev/rz1a</b>        (and mark the filesystem as clean)
	$ <b>mount /dev/rz1a /</b>
	$ <b>mount -t kernfs kern kern</b>
	$ <b>./install</b>

</pre>
		and proceed with the install. Good luck. :-)
	  <li>Answer "<b>y</b>" when asked if you wish to configure the network.
		(See the section about installing NetBSD/pmax for suitable
		network settings.)
	  <li>Install from "<b>c</b>" (cdrom), choose "<b>rz2</b>" as the cdrom device, and "<b>/</b>" as
		the directory containing the install sets.
	</ul>
  <p>
  <li>
For some unknown reason, the install script does not set the root
password! The first time you boot up OpenBSD after the install, you
need to go into single user mode and run <b>passwd root</b> to set
the root password, or you will not be able to log in at all!
<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -D2 -b -d openbsddisk.img -d 2c:openbsd_pmax_2.8.iso -j bsd -o '-s'</b>
</pre>
While you are at it, you might want to extract the X11 install sets
as well, as the installer seems to ignore them too. (Perhaps due to a bug
in the installer, perhaps because of the way I used mkisofs.)
<p>
Execute the following commands in the emulator:
<pre>
	# <b>fsck /dev/rz0a</b>
	# <b>mount /</b>
	# <b>passwd root</b>

	# <b>cd /</b>
	# <b>mount -t cd9660 /dev/rz2c /mnt</b>
	# <b>sh</b>
	# <b>for a in /mnt/[xX]*; do tar zxvf $a; done</b>
	# <b>ln -s /usr/X11R6/bin/Xcfbpmax /usr/X11R6/bin/X</b>
	# <b>ln -s /dev/fb0 /dev/mouse</b>
	# <b>echo /usr/X11R6/lib >> /etc/ld.so.conf</b>
	# <b>ldconfig</b>

	# <b>sync</b>
	# <b>halt</b>
</pre>
</ol>

<p>
NOTE: It is also possible to install via ftp instead of using a CDROM image. 
This is not much less awkward, you still need the simpleroot filesystem 
image, and you still have to manually add the X11 install sets and set the 
root password, and so on.

<p>
Once you have completed the installation procedure, the following command
will let you boot from the new rootdisk image:
<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -D2 -b -X -M64 -o '-aN' -d openbsddisk.img -j bsd</b>
</pre>

<p>
OpenBSD/pmax seems to work fine with dynamic binary translation (enabled 
by the <b>-b</b> command line option).

<p>
(Normally, you would be asked about which root device to use (rz0), but 
using -o '-aN' supresses that.)
<p>
When asked for which terminal type to use, when logging in as root,
enter <b>rcons</b> if you are using the graphical framebuffer,
<b>vt100</b> for text-mode.
<br>Use <b>startx</b> to start X windows.

<h3>How to install OpenBSD/arc in the emulator:</h3>

It is possible to run OpenBSD/arc on an emulated Acer PICA-61 in the
emulator.

<p>
(You should be aware of the fact that OpenBSD for the ARC platform died at 
release 2.3, so this will not give you an up-to-date OpenBSD system.
See
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/arc.html">http://www.openbsd.org/arc.html</a>
for more information.)

<p>
To install OpenBSD/arc onto an emulated harddisk image, follow these
instructions:

<p>
<ol>
  <li>Compile mips64emul:<pre>
	$ <b>./configure; make</b>

</pre>
  <li>Create an empty harddisk image, which will be the root disk
	that OpenBSD installs itself onto:<pre>
	$ <b>dd if=/dev/zero of=obsd_arc.img bs=1024 count=1 seek=700000</b>

</pre>
  <li>Download the entire arc directory from the ftp server: (approx. 75 MB)<pre>
	$ <b>wget -np -l 0 -r ftp://ftp.se.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/2.3/arc/</b>

</pre>

  <li>You now need to make an ISO image of the entire directory you downloaded.
	I recommend using <b>mkisofs</b> for that purpose. If you don't already
	have mkisofs installed on your system, you need to install that in
	order to do this.<pre>
	$ <b>mkisofs -o openbsd_arc_2.3.iso ftp.se.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/</b>

</pre>
  <li>Start the emulator using this command line:<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -X -A2 -d obsd_arc.img -d openbsd_arc_2.3.iso ftp.se.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/2.3/arc/bsd.rd.elf</b>

</pre>
	and proceed like you would do if you were installing OpenBSD
	on a real Acer PICA-61. (Answer 'no' when asked if you want to
	configure networking, and then install from CD-ROM.)
</ol>

<p>
Once the install has finished, the following command should let you 
boot from the harddisk image:
<p>
<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -X -A2 -d obsd_arc.img ftp.se.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/2.3/arc/bsd</b>

</pre>

<a name="ultrixinstall"></a>
<h3>How to install Ultrix/RISC in the emulator:</h3>

The following instructions should guide you through an install of Ultrix
onto a disk image:

<ol>
  <li>Compile mips64emul:<pre>
        $ <b>./configure; make</b>
   
</pre>
  <li>Create an empty harddisk image, which will be the root disk
        that Ultrix installs itself onto:<pre>
        $ <b>dd if=/dev/zero of=rootdisk.img bs=1024 count=1 seek=800000</b>

</pre>
  <li>Place your Ultrix installation media in your CDROM drive. (I'm assuming
        it is called /dev/cd0c here, replace that with the name of your
        CDROM drive, or the name of a .iso image file.)
        Then, start the emulator like this:<pre>
        $ <b>./mips64emul -X -b -M64 -D2 -d rootdisk.img -d bc:/dev/cd0c -j vmunix</b>

</pre>
        Once the first stage of the installation is done (restoring the root
	filesystem), you need to restart the emulator, booting from the 
	new rootdisk, to continue the installation process.
	This is done by removing the bootflag ('b') from the second
	diskimage argument:<pre>
        $ <b>./mips64emul -X -b -M64 -D2 -d rootdisk.img -d c:/dev/cd0c -j vmunix</b>

</pre>
</ol>

<p>
When the installation is completed, the following command should start  
Ultrix from the harddisk image:<pre>
        $ <b>./mips64emul -X -b -M64 -D2 -j vmunix -d rootdisk.img</b>
</pre>

<p>
Ultrix mostly seems to work with dynamic binary translation (enabled by 
the <b>-b</b> command line option). If you have a very fast
host machine, and use bintrans, you might experience a weird timer related
bug, which makes it impossible to logon to the system. It is triggered
when the emulation goes faster than any real DECstation machine was 
capable of running. A temporary workaround is to add <b>-I33000000</b>
to fix the emulated clock speed to 33 million instructions per emulated
second. (When using -CR4400, -I16000000 should be used instead.)

<p>
You can experiment with adding <b>-Z2</b> (for emulating a 
dual-headed workstation) or even <b>-Z3</b> (tripple-headed), and also the
<b>-Y2</b> option for scaling down the framebuffer windows by a factor 2x2.
There is also a <b>-z</b> option for supplying names of X11 displays to 
use. The following example starts Ultrix on an emulated tripple-headed 
workstation, on three different displays (remote1:0.0, localhost:0.0, and 
remote2:0.0), using no scaledown:<pre>
        $ <b>./mips64emul -M64 -bND2 -jgenvmunix -d rootdisk.img -XZ3 \
            -z remote1:0.0 -z localhost -z remote2:0.0</b>
</pre>

<p>
The X11 displays may differ in bit depth and endianness. Unfortunately, 
there is no way yet to set the scaledown factor on a per-window basis, so 
the scaledown factor affects all windows.

<p>
(If you didn't use -Z<i>n</i> during the installation, and 
compiled your own /vmunix, then it will not contain support for multiple 
graphics cards. To overcome this problem, use the generic kernel, <b>-j 
genvmunix</b>, whenever you are running the emulator with a different 
setup than the one you used when Ultrix was installed.)

<p>  
A note for the historically interested out there:
OSF/1 for MIPS is quite similar to Ultrix, so that is possible to run
as well.  If you are unsuccessful in installing Ultrix
or OSF/1 directly in the emulator, you can always install it on your real
machine onto a real SCSI disk, and then copy the contents of that SCSI
disk into a file (using <b>dd(1)</b>), and use that file as a disk image
file in the emulator.

<h3>How to run Sprite for DECstation in the emulator:</h3>

Sprite was a research operating system at the University of Berkeley.
The Unix Heritage Society (TUHS, <a href="http://www.tuhs.org">www.tuhs.org</a>)
has made available a copy of a Sprite harddisk image for a DECstation 5000/200.

<p>
The following instructions should let you run Sprite in the emulator:

  <li>Compile mips64emul:<pre>
	$ <b>./configure; make</b>

</pre>
  <li>Download the Sprite harddisk image using ftp or http:<pre>

	$ <b>./mips64emul -X -D2 -M128 -d ds5000.bt -j vmsprite -o ''</b>

</pre>
</ol>

<p>
The first time you boot up with the disk image, you will be asked a number 
of questions regarding network settings. If you feel like entering correct 
values, then you should use the following:
<p>

<pre>
    Your machine's Ethernet address:    10:20:30:40:50:60
    Your machine's IP:                  10.0.0.1
    Subnet mask:                        0xff000000
    Gateway's Ethernet address:         60:50:40:30:20:10
    Gateway's IP:                       10.0.0.254
</pre>

<p>
Unfortunately, at the end of <a href="http://www.es.embnet.org/Services/ftp/misc/TUHS/sprite/boot.txt">
http://www.es.embnet.org/Services/ftp/misc/TUHS/sprite/boot.txt</a>, the 
following sad statement can be found:
<pre>
    The bootable Sprite image is meant to be a demonstration of Sprite, not
    a robust Sprite system.  There are several missing things, such as 
    floating point and network support.
</pre>

<p>
Once you are logged in as root, running <b>xinit</b> will start the X11 
environment.

<p>
Sprite works fine with dynamic binary translation (enabled by
adding <b>-b</b> to the command line options).

<h3>How to install Debian GNU/Linux for DECstation in the emulator:</h3>

<p>
<font color="#ff0000">NOTE: This is experimental, and <i>extremely</i>
unstable. During my tests, even pressing the wrong key during the install
(for example the wrong cursor key) can cause a kernel Oops.
I <i>think</i> this has to do with interrupts from the serial controller.
Hopefully using the -U command line option will reduce the risk for such 
crashes. (I haven't had time to come up with a clean solution to this yet;
it feels like a buffer overflow in Linux' serial driver for the 5000/200,
but it is also likely that it is a bug in mips64emul.)
</font>

<p>
The following steps should let you install Debian GNU/Linux for DECstation
onto a harddisk image:

<p>
<ol>
  <li>Compile mips64emul:<pre>
	$ <b>./configure; make</b>

</pre>
  <li>Create an empty harddisk image, which will be the root disk
	that Debian installs itself onto:<pre>
	$ <b>dd if=/dev/zero of=debian.img bs=1024 count=1 seek=2000000</b>

</pre>
  <li>Download the install kernel:<pre>
	<a href="http://http.us.debian.org/debian/dists/testing/main/installer-mipsel/current/images/r3k-kn02/boot.img">http://http.us.debian.org/debian/dists/testing/main/</a>
	    <a href="http://http.us.debian.org/debian/dists/testing/main/installer-mipsel/current/images/r3k-kn02/boot.img">installer-mipsel/current/images/r3k-kn02/boot.img</a>

</pre>
  <li>For a text-mode installation, start the emulator like this:<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -D2 -b -U -M64 -o 'console=ttyS3' -d debian.img -O boot.img</b>

</pre>
</ol>

<p>
Debian GNU/Linux on DECstation in R3000 mode should work fine with dynamic
binary translation, enabled by the <b>-b</b> command line option. (Without
this option, the emulator is very slow.)

<p>
(If you want to, you can try <b>-X</b> instead of <b>-o 'console=ttyS3'</b> on
the command line. This will cause Linux to use the graphical framebuffer.
Unfortunately, Linux does not seem to have a driver for the DZ11 keyboard
controller yet, so you cannot interact with the system. You will see the
penguin in the upper lefthand corner while booting, and nicely rendered Unicode
characters, but that's about it.)

<p>
You need to enter some values during the installation procedure, for example
network settings. The following should work:
<p>
<pre>
    DHCP:                       No, choose "Configure network manually"
    IP address:                 10.0.0.1
    Netmask:                    255.0.0.0
    Gateway:                    10.0.0.254
    Name server addresses:      10.0.0.254
</pre>

<p>
Once the first phase of the install has finished, the following command 
should let you boot into Debian, and perform post-install configuration:<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -D2 -U -b -M64 -o 'console=ttyS3' -d debian.img</b>

</pre>

<p>
It seems that there's a problem with getting a login prompt on serial 
console (at least when I've done test installs), so when the installation 
is finished and you're supposed to get a login prompt, you need to press 
CTRL-C and type <b>quit</b>, and then:

<p>
<ol start="5">
  <li>Download a normal kernel (not a RAMDISK one).<pre>

</pre>
  <li>Boot Debian using the following command line:<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -D2 -U -b -M64 -o 'console=ttyS3 root=/dev/sda1 rw
		init=/bin/sh' -d debian.img vmlinux-2.4.27-r3k-kn02</b>

</pre>
	You'll enter single-user mode. You need to add a line to
	/etc/inittab, to enable logins via serial console.<pre>
	sh-2.05b# <b>echo 'T3:23:respawn:/sbin/getty -L ttyS3 9600 vt100' >> /etc/inittab</b>
	sh-2.05b# <b>echo 'ttyS3' >> /etc/securetty</b>
	sh-2.05b# <b>sync; umount /</b>
</pre>
</ol>

<p>
The system should now be ready for everyday use.

<p>
Use this command to boot from the completely installed disk image:<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -D2 -U -b -M64 -o 'console=ttyS3' -d debian.img</b>

</pre>(Note sda1 instead of sdc1.)
  <p>
  <li>To boot Linux, start the emulator like this:<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -D2 -U -b -M128 -o "console=ttyS3 root=/dev/sda1 ro" -d redhat.img vmlinux-2.4.27-r3k-kn02</b>

</pre>
</ol>

<p>
If you need to boot into single user mode, try the following:<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -D2 -U -b -o "console=ttyS3 root=/dev/sda1 rw init=/bin/sh" -d redhat.img vmlinux-2.4.27-r3k-kn02</b>

</pre>

<p>
Redhat Linux on DECstation in R3000 mode should work fine with dynamic binary 
translation (enabled by the <b>-b</b> command line option).

<p>
NOTE: You can add -XN and remove console=ttyS3 from the command line, if you want
to use a graphical framebuffer. Unfortunately, Linux doesn't have support for
the keyboard controller yet, so you cannot actually interact with the sytem. :-(

<h3>How to run Mach/PMAX in the emulator:</h3>

<p>
Read the following link if you want to know more about Mach in general:
<a href="http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/mach/public/www/mach.html">
http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/mach/public/www/mach.html</a>

<p>
<font color="#ff0000">NOTE: Mach for DECstation requires some files
(called 'startup' and 'emulator') which I haven't been able to find
on the web. Without these, Mach will not get very far. These
installation instructions are preliminary.
</font>

<p>
The following steps should let you experiment with running Mach
for DECstation in the emulator:

<p>
<ol>
  <li>Compile mips64emul: (<b>NOTE: --caches</b>)<pre>
	$ <b>./configure --caches; make</b>

</pre>
  <li>Download the pmax binary distribution for Mach 3.0:<pre>
        <a href="http://lost-contact.mit.edu/afs/athena/user/d/a/daveg/Info/Links/Mach/src/release/pmax.tar.Z">http://lost-contact.mit.edu/afs/athena/user/d/a/daveg/Info/Links/Mach/src/release/pmax.tar.Z</a>
	7263343 bytes, md5 = f9d76c240a6e169921a1df99ad560cc0

</pre>
  <li>Extract the Mach kernel:<pre>
        $ <b>tar xfvz pmax.tar.Z pmax_mach/special/mach.boot.MK83.STD+ANY</b>

</pre>
  <li>Create an empty disk image:<pre>
	$ <b>dd if=/dev/zero of=disk.img bs=1 count=512 seek=400000000</b>

</pre>
  <li>Load the contents of pmax.tar.Z onto the disk image. This is
	complicated, and should be described in more detail some time.
	For now, use your imagination. (For example using OpenBSD/pmax:
	<i>disklabel -E rz1; newfs -O /dev/rz1a;
	mount /dev/rz1a /mnt; cd /mnt; download pmax.tar.Z using ftp;
	tar xzvf pmax.tar.Z; mv pmax_mach/* .; rmdir pmax_mach;
	mkdir mach_servers;
	cd mach_servers;
	cp ../etc/mach_init .;
	cp ../tests/test_service startup;
	dd if=/dev/zero of=paging_file bs=65536 count=400;
	cd /; sync; umount /mnt</i>)
	<p>
  <li>Start the emulator with the following command:<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -D2 -X -d disk.img pmax_mach/special/mach.boot.MK83.STD+ANY</b>

</pre>
</ol>

<h3>Experiments with other kernels and guest OSes:</h3>

<p>
Operating system kernels and other test programs can be downloaded from 
various places. Here are links to some of the kernels that I usually 
experiment with. (The degree to which these work in the emulator varies 
a lot.)

<p>
<ul>
  <li>DECstation:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/pmax/">NetBSD/pmax</a>:
	<br><a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-2.0/pmax/binary/kernel/netbsd-INSTALL.gz">ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-2.0/pmax/binary/kernel/netbsd-INSTALL.gz</a>
	<br><a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-2.0/pmax/binary/kernel/netbsd-INSTALL.symbols.gz">ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-2.0/pmax/binary/kernel/netbsd-INSTALL.symbols.gz</a>
	<br>gunzip the files, and run the emulator with <b>-D2 -q -N -XY2</b>
	for a graphical framebuffer console. Remove <b>-XY2</b> and <b>-N</b> to use serial (stdin/stdout) console.
	Read <a href="#netbsdinstall">this section</a> about how to install NetBSD/pmax onto a harddisk image.
      <p>
      <li><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/pmax.html">OpenBSD/pmax</a>:
	<br><a href="ftp://ftp.se.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/2.8/pmax/bsd">ftp://ftp.se.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/2.8/pmax/bsd</a>
	<br>This is an old OpenBSD kernel in a.out format. Try <b>-D2</b>.
	<br>Read <a href="#openbsdinstall">this section</a> about how to install OpenBSD/pmax onto a harddisk image.
	It's a bit more complicated than installing NetBSD/pmax, but might work.
      <p>
      <li>Linux for DECstation:
	<br>Here is a Debian package containing a Linux 2.4.26 kernel for
		DECstation which supports framebuffer!
	<br><a href="http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/k/kernel-patch-2.4.26-mips/kernel-image-2.4.26-r3k-kn02_2.4.26-0.040505.1_mipsel.deb">http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/k/kernel-patch-2.4.26-mips/
	<br>kernel-image-2.4.26-r3k-kn02_2.4.26-0.040505.1_mipsel.deb</a>
	<br>Run the following commands to extract the kernel:<pre>
	<b>ar x kernel-image-2.4.26-r3k-kn02_2.4.26-0.040505.1_mipsel.deb data.tar.gz</b>
	<b>tar xfzv data.tar.gz ./boot/vmlinux-2.4.26-r3k-kn02</b>
	<b>mv boot/vmlinux-* .; rmdir boot</b>
</pre>
	<br>To try with the framebuffer: <b>-D2 -X vmlinux-2.4.26-r3k-kn02</b>
	<br>To try with serial console: <b>-D2 -o 'console=ttyS3' vmlinux-2.4.26-r3k-kn02</b>
	<br>Read <a href="#declinux">this section</a> about how to run a Debian Linux install kernel.
	<br>Here are some older kernels (these don't support framebuffer, I think):
		<a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~vhouten/mipsel/kernels.html">http://www.xs4all.nl/~vhouten/mipsel/kernels.html</a>
	<br>Note: Make sure you add <b>-CR4400</b> to the command line for
		R4000 kernels, as Linux doesn't autodetect CPU type at runtime.
      <p>
      <li>Sprite:
	<br>The Unix Heritage Society (TUHS, <a href="http://www.tuhs.org">www.tuhs.org</a>)

If the framebuffer device for the specific machine mode you are running is
implemented well enough, then the framebuffer window will look exactly like
the real machine's screen, pixel by pixel.
<p>
For many emulated graphics cards in the emulator (or emulation modes), the
resolution is fixed. It is possible in some emulation modes, however, to change
cards completely. The TURBOchannel cards on some of the emulated DECstation
models support this. (The -D2 model is luckily one of these models.)
This is not implemented as a command-line option yet, so you have to modify
the source code to do this.
<p>
The <i>turbochannel_default_gfx_card</i> string defines
the name of the graphics card. Look in src/machine.c for this line:
<p>
<pre>
	<b>char *turbochannel_default_gfx_card = "PMAG-BA";</b>
</pre>
<p>
Different cards have different resolution.

If the framebuffer window is too large, is is possible to scale it down
by adding <b>-Y2</b> to the command line.

<a name="networking"></a>
<h3>Networking:</h3>

It is possible to let the guest OS running inside the emulator get access to
the Internet. If you are interested in the technical details, and the 
reasons why networking is implemented in the emulator the way it currently 
is implemented, you might want to read the <a href="technical.html#net">
networking section in the technical documentation</a>.
<p>
The guest OS running inside the emulator uses a private IPv4 address, such
as 10.0.0.1, and the emulator acts as a NAT-like gateway/firewall at IPv4
address 10.0.0.254. To the outside world it will seem like it is the host's
OS that connects to other machines on the internet, not the guest OS.
<p>
<font color="#ff0000">NOTE: This is still experimental!
As of 2004-07-21, ARP + ICMP + UDP + TCP are emulated well enough to let 
NetBSD and OpenBSD install via ftp, and use the network for many normal 
activities, but not everything works yet.</font>

<a name="hello"></a>
<h3>Hello world:</h3>

You might want to use the emulator to develop programs on your own,
not just run precompiled kernels such as NetBSD. To get started, I'd recommend
you do two things:
<ul>
  <li>Build and install a cross-compiler for MIPS.
  <li>Compile this hello world program, and run it in the emulator.
</ul>
<p>
If the emulator is launched without specifying which machine to emulate,
it will emulate only a CPU and very few devices. One of those devices
is a console putchar() device, at a fixed address.
<pre>
	/*  Hello world for mips64emul  */

	#define	PUTCHAR_ADDRESS		0xb0000000

	void printchar(char ch)
	{
		*((volatile unsigned char *) PUTCHAR_ADDRESS) = ch;
	}

	void printstr(char *s)
	{
		while (*s)
			printchar(*s++);
	}

	void f(void)
	{
		printstr("Hello world\n");
		for (;;)
			;
	}
</pre>
This hello world program is available here as well: <a href="hello.c">hello.c</a>
<p>
I'd recommend you build a GCC cross compiler for the <b>mips64-unknown-elf</b>
target, and install it. Other compilers might work too, but GCC is good because
of its portability. Then try to compile the hello world program:
<pre>
	$ <b>mips64-unknown-elf-gcc hello.c -mips4 -mabi=64 -c</b>
	$ <b>mips64-unknown-elf-ld -Ttext 0x80030000 -e f hello.o -o hello --oformat=elf64-bigmips</b>
	$ <b>file hello</b>
	hello: ELF 64-bit MSB mips-4 executable, MIPS R3000_BE, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, not stripped
	$ <b>./mips64emul -q hello</b>
	Hello world

	$ <b>mips64-unknown-elf-gcc hello.c -c</b>
	$ <b>mips64-unknown-elf-ld -Ttext 0x80030000 -e f hello.o -o hello</b>
	$ <b>file hello</b>
	hello: ELF 32-bit MSB mips-3 executable, MIPS R3000_BE, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, not stripped
	$ <b>./mips64emul -q hello</b>
	Hello world
</pre>
As you can see above, a GCC configured for mips64-unknown-elf can produce
both 64-bit and 32-bit binaries.
<p>
Hopefully this is enough to get you inspired. :-)

<h3>Porting operating systems to MIPS using mips64emul:</h3>

Is this a good idea?  The answer is yes and no, depending on what you are
trying to port to. If you are developing an operating system or operating
system kernel of your own, and wish to target MIPS-like systems in general,
then the answer might be yes, for experimental purposes.
<p>
However, if you think that you can port an operating system
to, say, the Silicon Graphics machine mode of mips64emul and hope that your
operating system will run on a real SGI machine, then you will most
likely fail. mips64emul simply does not emulate things well enough for that to work.
Another example would be specific CPU details; if your code depends on,
say, R10000 specifics, chances are that mips64emul will not be sufficient.
<p>
In many cases, hardware devices in mips64emul are only implemented well
enough to fool for example NetBSD that they are working correctly, while in fact
they don't work very much at all.  Please keep this in mind, if you plan
to use mips64emul when porting your code to MIPS.


<p><br>
<a name="disk"></a>
<h3>How to start the emulator with a disk image:</h3>

Add <i>-d [prefixes:]diskimagefilename</i> to the command line, where prefixes
are one or more single-character options. Run mips64emul with no command line
arguments to get a list of possible options.
<p>
Here are some examples. If you want to run a NetBSD/pmax kernel on an
emulated DECstation machine, you would use a command line such as this:
<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -D2 -d pmax_diskimage.fs netbsd-pmax-INSTALL</b>
</pre>
<p>
NOTE: For some emulation modes, such as the DECstation mode, you do 
<i>not</i> have to specify the name of the kernel, if the disk image is 
bootable!
<p>
It is possible to have more than one disk. For each -d argument, a disk
image is added; the first will be SCSI target 0, the second will be target 1, and so on,
unless you specify explicitly which ID number the devices should have.
<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -D2 -d disk0.raw -d disk1.raw -d 5:disk2.raw netbsd-pmax-INSTALL</b>
</pre>
Note: In the example above, disk2.raw will get scsi id 5.
<p>
If a filename has a 'c' prefix, or ends with ".iso", then it is assumed to be
a CDROM device (this can be overridden with a 'd' prefix, to force a read/write disk).
For example, the following command would start the emulator with two
CDROM images, and one harddisk image:
<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -D2 -d image.iso -d disk0.img -d C:second_cdrom.img netbsd-pmax-INSTALL</b>
</pre>
Usually, the device with the lowest id becomes the boot device. To override
this, add a 'b' prefix to one of the devices:
<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -D2 -d rootdisk.img -d bc:install-cd.iso name_of_kernel</b>
</pre>
If you have a physical CD-ROM drive on the host machine, say /dev/cd0c, you can
use it as a CD-ROM directly accessible from within the emulator:
<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -D2 -d rootdisk.img -d bc:/dev/cd0c name_of_kernel</b>
</pre>
It is probably possible to use harddisks as well this way, but I would not
recommend it.
<p>
Using emulated tape drives is a bit more complicated than disks, because a
tape can be made up of several "files" with space in between. The solution
I have choosen is to have one file in the host's file system space for each
tape file. The prefix for using tapes is 't', and the filename given is
for the <i>first</i> file on that tape (number zero, implicitly). For
files following file nr 0, a dot and the filenumber is appended to the
filename.
<p>
As an example, starting the emulator with
<pre>
	<b>-d t4:mytape.img</b>
</pre>
will cause SCSI id 4 to be a tape device, using the following file number
to name translation scheme:
<p>
<center>
 <table border="0">
  <tr>
    <td><b>File number:</b></td>
    <td><b>File name in the host's filesystem:</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">0</td>
    <td align="left">mytape.img</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">1</td>
    <td align="left">mytape.img.1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">2</td>
    <td align="left">mytape.img.2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">..</td>
    <td align="left">..</td>
  </tr>
 </table>
</center>
<p>
If you already have a number of tape files, which should be placed on the
same emulated tape, then you might not want to rename all those files.
Use symbolic links instead (ln -s).
<p>
There is another advantage to using symbolic links for tape filenames:
every time a tape is rewound, it is reopened using the filename given
on the command line. By changing what the symbolic name points to,
you can "switch tapes" without quiting and restarting the emulator.

<h3>How to extract large gzipped disk images:</h3>

Unix filesystems usually support large files with "holes". Holes are 
zero-filled blocks that don't actually exist on disk. This is very 
practical for emulated disk images, as it is possible to create a very 
large disk image without using up much space at all.

<p>
Using gzip and gunzip on disk images can be <i>very</i> slow, as these 
files can be multiple gigabytes large, but this is usually necessary for
transfering disk images over the internet. If you receive a gzipped disk 
image, say disk.img.gz, and run a naive
<p>
<pre>
	$ <b>gunzip disk.img.gz</b>
</pre>
<p>
on it, you will not end up with an optimized file unless 
gunzip supports that. (In my experiments, it doesn't.)  In plain English, 
if you type <b>ls -l</b> and the filesize is 9 GB, it will actually occupy 
9 GB of disk space! This is often unacceptable.
<p>
Using a simple tool which only writes blocks that are non-zero, a lot of 
space can be saved. Compile the program cp_removeblocks in the 
experiments/ directory, and type:
<p>
<pre>
	$ <b>gunzip -c disk.img.gz | ./cp_removeblocks /dev/stdin disk.img</b>
</pre>

<p>
This will give you a disk.img which looks like it is 9 GB, and works like
the real file, but the holes are not written out to the disk. (You can see
this by running for example <b>du disk.img</b> to see the physical block
count.)



<p><br>
<a name="userland"></a>
<h3>Running userland binaries:</h3>

You can run (some) userland programs as well. This will not emulate any
particular machine, but instead try to translate syscalls from for example
NetBSD/pmax into the host's OS' syscalls. For this to work, you have
to add <b>--userland</b> to the command line when running ./configure.

<p>
For example, running /bin/hostname
or /bin/date and similarly trivial programs from the NetBSD/pmax distribution
works:
<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -qu1 pmax_bin_hostname</b>
	tab.csbnet.se
	$ <b>./mips64emul -qu1 pmax_bin_date</b>
	Sun Jan 25 02:26:14 GMT 2004
	$ <b>./mips64emul -qu1 pmax_bin_sleep</b>
	usage: pmax_bin_sleep seconds
	$ <b>./mips64emul -qu1 pmax_bin_sleep 5</b>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -qu1 pmax_bin_sync</b>
</pre>
There's also an Ultrix4 emulation mode:
<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -qu2 ultrix4_bin_date</b>
	UNIMPLEMENTED ultrix syscall 54
	UNIMPLEMENTED ultrix syscall 62
	Mon Feb  9 12:50:59 WET 2004
	$ <b>./mips64emul -qu2 ultrix4_bin_hostname</b>
	tab.csbnet.se
</pre>
NOTE: Userland syscall emulation is still in its beginning stages, so almost
nothing works. It's mostly a proof-of-concept implementation, to show that 
such cross-platform userland emulation is possible.
<p>
IRIX userland emulation might theoretically also be possible to add.

<h3>Using a PROM image from a DECstation:</h3>

<i>(The general ideas in this section applies to using ROM images from other machines as well.)</i>
<p>
Raw PROM images from real machines can, in a few cases, be used. One
case which I've tried is to use a DECstation 5000/125 PROM image.
ROM images from other machines might work as well, but ROM code is
usually much more sensitive to correctness of the emulator than
operating system kernels or userland programs are.
<p>
The image first needs to be extracted from the machine. I presume
that these PROMs are not legal to redistribute, so you really need
to extract the PROM from a physical machine that you own. There are
several ways to do this.
<ul>
  <li>Use hardware to read the PROM chip(s) directly. Not easy if you
	don't have such a hardware reader.
  <li>Copy the PROM memory range into a file, from a running
	operating system. You need a running OS, and it must
	have access to the PROM memory range. NetBSD, for example,
	doesn't allow that from userland.
  <li>Hook up a serial console and dump using the PROM's own dump
	command.
</ul>
<p>
The easiest way is to hook up a serial console. The terminal must be
able to capture output to a file.
<p>
These are approximately the commands that I used:
<pre>
        >><b>cnfg</b>                             <i>Show machine configuration</i>

        >><b>printenv</b>                         <i>Show environment variables</i>

        >><b>setenv more 0</b>                    <i>This turns off the More messages</i>

        >><b>e -x 0xbfc00000:0xbfffffff</b>       <i>Dump the PROM data</i>
</pre>
<p>
Remember that DECstation are little endian, so if the dump data
looks like this:
<pre>
        bfc00000:  0x0bf0007e
</pre>
then the bytes in memory are actually 0x7e, 0x00, 0xf0, and 0x0b.
<p>
At 9600 bps, about 10KB can be dumped per minute, so it takes a while.
Once enough of the PROM has been dumped, you can press CTRL-C to break out.
Then, restore the more environment variable:
<pre>
        >><b>setenv more 24</b>
</pre>
<p>
Now, convert the data you just saved (little-endian words -> bytes),
and store in a file. Let's call this file DECstation5000_125_promdump.bin.
<pre>
        $ <b>./decprom_dump_txt_to_bin DECstation5000_125_promdump.txt DECstation5000_125_promdump.bin</b>
</pre>
This binary image can now be used in the emulator:
<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -D3 -Q -M128 -q 0xbfc00000:DECstation5000_125_promdump.bin</b>

	KN02-BA V5.7e   
	?TFL:  3/scc/access (1:Ln1 reg-12: actual=0x00 xpctd=0x01) [KN02-BA]

	 boot=
	 testaction=q
	 haltaction=h
	 more=24
	 #=3
	 console=*
	 osconsole=3
	>>
</pre>
<i>(Note: at the moment, this doesn't work. I must have broken something when
fixing something else, but this is what it looked like at the time.)</i>
<p>
During bootup, the PROM complains <i>a lot</i> about hardware failures.
That's because the emulator doesn't emulate the hardware well enough yet.
<p>
The command line options used are:
-D3 for DECstation model 3 (5000/xxx), -Q to supress the emulator's own PROM
call emulation, -M128 for 128MB RAM (because mips64emul doesn't correctly
emulate memory detection well enough for the PROM to accept, so it will
always believe there is 128MB ram anyway), and -q to supress debug messages.
The 0xbfc00000 in front of the filename tells mips64emul that it is a raw
binary file which should be loaded at a specific virtual address.
