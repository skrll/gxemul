<h3>General notes on running "guest OSes":</h3>

The emulator works well enough to run complete operating systems. These 
are often refered to as "guest" operating systems.

<p>
Although it is possible to let a guest OS access real hardware, such as
harddisks, it is much more flexible and attractive to simulate harddisks
using files residing in the host's filesystem. On Unix-like systems, files
may contain holes, which makes this really simple. To the guest operating
system, the harddisk image looks and acts like a real disk.








<p><br>
<a name="netbsdinstall"></a>
<h3>How to install NetBSD/pmax in the emulator:</h3>

To install NetBSD/pmax onto a harddisk image in the emulator, follow these
instructions:

<p>
<ol start="1">
  <li>Compile mips64emul:<pre>
	$ <b>./configure; make</b>

</pre>
  <li>Create an empty harddisk image, which will be the root disk
	that NetBSD installs itself onto:<pre>
	$ <b>dd if=/dev/zero of=netbsddisk.img bs=1 count=512 seek=1900000000</b>

</pre>
</ol>
<p>
From this point, there are two separate ways to continue the installation.
You can either download a CD-ROM iso image (and let the installation 
program copy files from the CD-ROM image to the harddisk image), or you 
can install via ftp. For an installation from a CD-ROM image, follow these 
steps:
<p>
<ol start="3">

  <li>Download a NetBSD CD-ROM iso image:<pre>
	<a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/iso/1.6.2/pmaxcd.iso">ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/iso/1.6.2/pmaxcd.iso</a>
	or
	<a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/iso/2.0/pmaxcd.iso">ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/iso/2.0/pmaxcd.iso</a>

</pre>
  <li>Start the emulator like this:<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -X -b -D2 -d netbsddisk.img -d bc:pmaxcd.iso</b>
</pre>
</ol>
<p>
For an ftp install, substitute steps 3 and 4 above with these:
<p>
<ol start="3">

  <li>Download a NetBSD pmax INSTALL kernel, and gunzip it:<pre>
	<a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.6.2/pmax/binary/kernel/netbsd-INSTALL.gz">ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.6.2/pmax/binary/kernel/netbsd-INSTALL.gz</a>
	or
	<a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-2.0/pmax/binary/kernel/netbsd-INSTALL.gz">ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-2.0/pmax/binary/kernel/netbsd-INSTALL.gz</a>

	$ <b>gunzip netbsd-INSTALL.gz</b>

</pre>
  <li>Start the emulator like this:<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -X -b -D2 -d netbsddisk.img -O netbsd-INSTALL</b>
</pre>
</ol>

<p>
(If you don't want to use a graphical framebuffer during the install,
you can remove <b>-X</b> from the command line, but then make sure you
choose 'vt100' when prompted with which terminal type to use, and not
'rcons'.)

<p>
Then proceed like you would do if you were installing NetBSD on a real
DECstation. If you are installing from the network, then suitable networking 
parameters are as follows:<pre>
	Which device shall I use? [le0]: <b>le0</b>
	..
	Your DNS domain: <b>mydomain.com</b>
	Your host name: <b>foo</b>
	Your IPv4 number: <b>10.0.0.1</b>
	IPv4 Netmask [0xff000000]: <b>0xff000000</b>
	IPv4 gateway: <b>10.0.0.254</b>
	IPv4 name server: <b>10.0.0.254</b>
</pre>

<p>
(If using 10.0.0.254 as the nameserver fails, then try entering the
IP number of a real-world nameserver instead.)

<p>
When the installation is completed, the following command should start
NetBSD from the harddisk image:<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -X -b -M64 -D2 -d netbsddisk.img</b>
</pre>

<p>
Use <b>startx</b> to start X windows.

<p>
<font color="#ff0000">NOTE:</font> For some reason, NetBSD 2.0 doesn't
work with X out-of-the-box on pmax. It seems that this has to do with a 
switch to WSCONS. For now, if you want X, then try NetBSD 1.6.2.

<p>
If you want to run without the X framebuffer, use this instead:<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -D2 -b -d netbsddisk.img</b>
</pre>

<p>
NetBSD/pmax seems to work fine with dynamic binary translation (enabled 
by the <b>-b</b> command line option) in R3000 mode. NetBSD also
supports R4000-like CPUs on pmax, but the bintrans support for R4000 in
the emulator is less stable than for R3000.

<h3>How to install NetBSD/arc in the emulator:</h3>

It is possible to run NetBSD/arc on an emulated Acer PICA-61 in the
emulator.

<p>
To install NetBSD/arc from a CDROM image onto an emulated harddisk image,
follow these instructions:

<p>
<ol start="1">
  <li>Compile mips64emul:<pre>
	$ <b>./configure; make</b>

</pre>
  <li>Create an empty harddisk image, which will be the root disk
	that NetBSD installs itself onto:<pre>
	$ <b>dd if=/dev/zero of=nbsd_arc.img bs=1024 count=1 seek=900000</b>

</pre>
  <li>Download a NetBSD/arc CDROM image from ftp:<pre>
	<a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/iso/1.6.2/arccd.iso">ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/iso/1.6.2/arccd.iso</a>

</pre>
  <li>Download a NetBSD/arc installation (ramdisk) kernel,
	and gunzip it:<pre>
	<a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.6.2/arc/binary/kernel/netbsd.RAMDISK.gz">ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.6.2/arc/binary/kernel/netbsd.RAMDISK.gz</a>

</pre>
  <li>Start the emulator using this command line:<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -A2 -b -d nbsd_arc.img -d arccd.iso netbsd.RAMDISK</b>

</pre>
  <li>From now on, you have to use your imagination, as there is no
	automatic installation program for NetBSD/arc. Here are some tips
	and hints on how you can proceed with the install:<pre>
	$ <b>mount /dev/cd0a /mnt2</b>
	$ <b>disklabel -i -I sd0</b>    (for example 'a', '4.2BSD', '1c',
	    '700M', 'b', 'swap', '701M', '$', 'P', 'W', 'y', and 'Q')
	$ <b>newfs /dev/sd0a</b>
	$ <b>mount /dev/sd0a /mnt</b>
	$ <b>cd /mnt</b>
	$ <b>for a in /mnt2/arc/binary/sets/*.tgz; do tar xvzpf $a; done</b>
	$ <b>cd dev; sh MAKEDEV all</b>
	$ <b>cd ../etc; echo "rc_configured=YES" &gt;&gt; rc.conf</b>
	$ <b>cat > /mnt/etc/fstab</b>
	    /dev/sd0a / ffs rw 1 1
	    /dev/sd0b none swap sw 0 0
	    (ctrl-d)
	$ <b>cd /; umount /mnt; umount /mnt2</b>
	$ <b>halt</b>

</pre>
  <li>Download a generic NetBSD/arc kernel,
	and gunzip it:<pre>
	<a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.6.2/arc/binary/kernel/netbsd-GENERIC.gz">ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-1.6.2/arc/binary/kernel/netbsd-GENERIC.gz</a>

</pre>
</ol>

<p>
You can now use the generic NetBSD/arc kernel to boot from the harddisk 
image, using the following command:
<p>
<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -A2 -b -d nbsd_arc.img netbsd-GENERIC</b>

</pre>

<p>
Using <b>-b</b> (enabling dynamic binary translation), as in the instructions
above, is not 100% stable. If you experiment weird crashes, try removing that
option and try again.

<h3>How to install OpenBSD/pmax in the emulator:</h3>

Installing OpenBSD/pmax is a bit harder than installing NetBSD/pmax.
You should first read the section above on how to install NetBSD/pmax,
before continuing here. If you have never installed OpenBSD on any
architecture, then you need a great deal of patience to do this.
If, on the other hand you are used to installing OpenBSD, then
this should be no problem for you.

<p>
OpenBSD/pmax died at release 2.8 of OpenBSD, so you should be
aware of the fact that this will not give you an up-to-date OpenBSD
system. The files are available at this URL:
<pre>
	<a href="ftp://ftp.se.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/2.8/pmax/">ftp://ftp.se.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/2.8/pmax/</a>
</pre>

<p>
Following these instructions <i>might</i> work. If not, then use
common sense and imagination to modify them as you see fit.

<p>
<ol>
  <li>Compile mips64emul:<pre>
	$ <b>./configure; make</b>

</pre>
  <li>Create an empty harddisk image, which will be the root disk
	that OpenBSD installs itself onto:<pre>
	$ <b>dd if=/dev/zero of=openbsddisk.img bs=1 count=512 seek=900000000</b>

</pre>
  <li>Download the entire pmax directory from the ftp server: (approx. 99 MB)<pre>
	$ <b>wget -r ftp://ftp.se.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/2.8/pmax/</b>

</pre>

  <li>Execute the following commands:<pre>
	$ <b>mv ftp.se.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/2.8/pmax/simpleroot28.fs.gz .</b>
	$ <b>gunzip simpleroot28.fs.gz</b>
	$ <b>chmod +w simpleroot28.fs</b>		&lt;--- make sure

</pre>
  <li>You now need to make an ISO image of the entire directory you downloaded.
	I recommend using <b>mkisofs</b> for that purpose. If you don't already
	have mkisofs installed on your system, you need to install that in
	order to do this.<pre>
	$ <b>mkisofs -o openbsd_pmax_2.8.iso ftp.se.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/2.8/pmax</b>

</pre>
  <li>Start the emulator with all three (!) disk images:<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -D2 -b -d openbsddisk.img -d b:simpleroot28.fs -j bsd -d c:openbsd_pmax_2.8.iso</b>

</pre>
	(If you add -X, you will run with the graphical framebuffer. This is <i>REALLY</i> slow
	because the console has to scroll a lot during the install. I don't recommend it.)
  <p>
  <li>Go on with the installation as you would do if you were installing on a real machine.
	If you are not used to the OpenBSD installer, then this will most likely
	be a very uncomfortable experience. Some important things to keep in mind are:
	<ul>
	  <li>rz0 is the rootdisk you wish to install onto.
	  <li>rz1 is the simpleroot image.
	  <li>rz2 is the CDROM containing the "install sets".
	  <li>When asked for the "<b>root device?</b>", enter <b>rz1</b>.
	  <li>At "<b>Enter pathname of shell or RETURN for sh:</b>", press enter.
	  <li>At the # prompt, do the following:<pre>
	$ <b>fsck /dev/rz1a</b>        (and mark the filesystem as clean)
	$ <b>mount /dev/rz1a /</b>
	$ <b>mount -t kernfs kern kern</b>
	$ <b>./install</b>

</pre>
		and proceed with the install. Good luck. :-)
	  <li>Answer "<b>y</b>" when asked if you wish to configure the network.
		(See the section about installing NetBSD/pmax for suitable
		network settings.)
	  <li>Install from "<b>c</b>" (cdrom), choose "<b>rz2</b>" as the cdrom device, and "<b>/</b>" as
		the directory containing the install sets.
	</ul>
  <p>
  <li>
For some unknown reason, the install script does not set the root
password! The first time you boot up OpenBSD after the install, you
need to go into single user mode and run <b>passwd root</b> to set
the root password, or you will not be able to log in at all!
<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -D2 -b -d openbsddisk.img -d 2c:openbsd_pmax_2.8.iso -j bsd -o '-s'</b>
</pre>
While you are at it, you might want to extract the X11 install sets
as well, as the installer seems to ignore them too. (Perhaps due to a bug
in the installer, perhaps because of the way I used mkisofs.)
<p>
Execute the following commands in the emulator:
<pre>
	# <b>fsck /dev/rz0a</b>
	# <b>mount /</b>
	# <b>passwd root</b>

	# <b>cd /</b>
	# <b>mount -t cd9660 /dev/rz2c /mnt</b>
	# <b>sh</b>
	# <b>for a in /mnt/[xX]*; do tar zxvf $a; done</b>
	# <b>ln -s /usr/X11R6/bin/Xcfbpmax /usr/X11R6/bin/X</b>
	# <b>ln -s /dev/fb0 /dev/mouse</b>
	# <b>echo /usr/X11R6/lib >> /etc/ld.so.conf</b>
	# <b>ldconfig</b>

	# <b>sync</b>
	# <b>halt</b>
</pre>
</ol>

<p>
NOTE: It is also possible to install via ftp instead of using a CDROM image. 
This is not much less awkward, you still need the simpleroot filesystem 
image, and you still have to manually add the X11 install sets and set the 
root password, and so on.

<p>
Once you have completed the installation procedure, the following command
will let you boot from the new rootdisk image:
<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -D2 -b -X -M64 -o '-aN' -d openbsddisk.img -j bsd</b>
</pre>

<p>
OpenBSD/pmax seems to work fine with dynamic binary translation (enabled 
by the <b>-b</b> command line option).

<p>
(Normally, you would be asked about which root device to use (rz0), but 
using -o '-aN' supresses that.)
<p>
When asked for which terminal type to use, when logging in as root,
enter <b>rcons</b> if you are using the graphical framebuffer,
<b>vt100</b> for text-mode.
<br>Use <b>startx</b> to start X windows.

<h3>How to install OpenBSD/arc in the emulator:</h3>

It is possible to run OpenBSD/arc on an emulated Acer PICA-61 in the
emulator.

<p>
(You should be aware of the fact that OpenBSD for the ARC platform died at 
release 2.3, so this will not give you an up-to-date OpenBSD system.
See
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/arc.html">http://www.openbsd.org/arc.html</a>
for more information.)

<p>
To install OpenBSD/arc onto an emulated harddisk image, follow these
instructions:

<p>
<ol>
  <li>Compile mips64emul:<pre>
	$ <b>./configure; make</b>

</pre>
  <li>Create an empty harddisk image, which will be the root disk
	that OpenBSD installs itself onto:<pre>
	$ <b>dd if=/dev/zero of=obsd_arc.img bs=1024 count=1 seek=700000</b>

</pre>
  <li>Download the entire arc directory from the ftp server: (approx. 75 MB)<pre>
	$ <b>wget -np -l 0 -r ftp://ftp.se.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/2.3/arc/</b>

</pre>

  <li>You now need to make an ISO image of the entire directory you downloaded.
	I recommend using <b>mkisofs</b> for that purpose. If you don't already
	have mkisofs installed on your system, you need to install that in
	order to do this.<pre>
	$ <b>mkisofs -o openbsd_arc_2.3.iso ftp.se.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/</b>

</pre>
  <li>Start the emulator using this command line:<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -X -b -A2 -d obsd_arc.img -d openbsd_arc_2.3.iso \
	    ftp.se.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/2.3/arc/bsd.rd.elf</b>

</pre>
	and proceed like you would do if you were installing OpenBSD
	on a real Acer PICA-61. (Answer 'no' when asked if you want to
	configure networking, and then install from CD-ROM.)
</ol>

<p>
Once the install has finished, the following command should let you 
boot from the harddisk image:
<p>
<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -X -b -A2 -d obsd_arc.img ftp.se.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/2.3/arc/bsd</b>

</pre>

<p>
(The <b>-b</b> command line option enables dynamic binary translation,
which isn't always 100% stable, so if things seem buggy you might want
to try to remove that from the command line.)

<h3>How to run OpenBSD/sgi in the emulator:</h3>

<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/sgi.html">OpenBSD/sgi</a>
can theoretically run in mips64emul on an emulated O2 (SGI-IP32)
with root on nfs.

<p>
<font color="#ff0000">NOTE: I haven't succeeded with this yet.</font>

<p>
<font color="#0000f0">
[&nbsp;2005-02-09: There is no stable release yet of OpenBSD/sgi, but there
are -current snapshots available on ftp sites.&nbsp;]</font>

<p>
mips64emul does not yet emulate the AHC PCI SCSI controller in the O2, so 
another emulated machine must be used as the nfs root server, and the
emulated O2 machine must boot as a
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=diskless&manpath=OpenBSD+Current&format=html">diskless</a>

        $ <b>dd if=/dev/zero of=rootdisk.img bs=1024 count=1 seek=800000</b>

</pre>
  <li>Place your Ultrix installation media in your CDROM drive. (I'm assuming
        it is called /dev/cd0c here, replace that with the name of your
        CDROM drive, or the name of a .iso image file.)
        Then, start the emulator like this:<pre>
        $ <b>./mips64emul -X -b -M64 -D2 -d rootdisk.img -d bc:/dev/cd0c -j vmunix</b>

</pre>
        Once the first stage of the installation is done (restoring the root
	filesystem), you need to restart the emulator, booting from the 
	new rootdisk, to continue the installation process.
	This is done by removing the bootflag ('b') from the second
	diskimage argument:<pre>
        $ <b>./mips64emul -X -b -M64 -D2 -d rootdisk.img -d c:/dev/cd0c -j vmunix</b>

</pre>
</ol>

<p>
When the installation is completed, the following command should start  
Ultrix from the harddisk image:<pre>
        $ <b>./mips64emul -X -b -M64 -D2 -j vmunix -d rootdisk.img</b>
</pre>

<p>
Ultrix mostly seems to work with dynamic binary translation (enabled by 
the <b>-b</b> command line option). If you have a very fast
host machine, and use bintrans, you might experience a weird timer related
bug, which makes it impossible to logon to the system. It is triggered
when the emulation goes faster than any real DECstation machine was 
capable of running. A temporary workaround is to add <b>-I33000000</b>
to fix the emulated clock speed to 33 million instructions per emulated
second. (When using -CR4400, -I16000000 should be used instead.)

<p>
You can experiment with adding <b>-Z2</b> (for emulating a 
dual-headed workstation) or even <b>-Z3</b> (tripple-headed), and also the
<b>-Y2</b> option for scaling down the framebuffer windows by a factor 2x2.
There is also a <b>-z</b> option for supplying names of X11 displays to 
use. The following example starts Ultrix on an emulated tripple-headed 
workstation, on three different displays (remote1:0.0, localhost:0.0, and 
remote2:0.0), using no scaledown:<pre>
        $ <b>./mips64emul -M64 -bND2 -jgenvmunix -d rootdisk.img -XZ3 \
            -z remote1:0.0 -z localhost -z remote2:0.0</b>
</pre>

<p>
The X11 displays may differ in bit depth and endianness. Unfortunately, 
there is no way yet to set the scaledown factor on a per-window basis, so 
the scaledown factor affects all windows.

<p>
(If you didn't use -Z<i>n</i> during the installation, and 
compiled your own /vmunix, then it will not contain support for multiple 
graphics cards. To overcome this problem, use the generic kernel, <b>-j 
genvmunix</b>, whenever you are running the emulator with a different 
setup than the one you used when Ultrix was installed.)

<p>  
A note for the historically interested out there:
OSF/1 for MIPS is quite similar to Ultrix, so that is possible to run
as well.  If you are unsuccessful in installing Ultrix
or OSF/1 directly in the emulator, you can always install it on your real
machine onto a real SCSI disk, and then copy the contents of that SCSI
disk into a file (using <b>dd(1)</b>), and use that file as a disk image
file in the emulator.

<h3>How to run Sprite for DECstation in the emulator:</h3>

Sprite was a research operating system at the University of Berkeley.
The Unix Heritage Society (TUHS, <a href="http://www.tuhs.org">www.tuhs.org</a>)
has made available a copy of a Sprite harddisk image for a DECstation 5000/200.
If you want to find out more about Sprite in general, read
<a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/projects/sprite/retrospective.html">
http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/projects/sprite/retrospective.html</a>.

<p>
The following instructions should let you run Sprite in the emulator:

<p>
<ol>
  <li>Compile mips64emul:<pre>
	$ <b>./configure; make</b>

</pre>
  <li>Download the Sprite harddisk image using ftp or http:<pre>
	<a href="http://www.es.embnet.org/Services/ftp/misc/TUHS/sprite/ds5000.bt">http://www.es.embnet.org/Services/ftp/misc/TUHS/sprite/ds5000.bt</a>
	or <a href="ftp://ftp.es.embnet.org/misc/TUHS/sprite/ds5000.bt">ftp://ftp.es.embnet.org/misc/TUHS/sprite/ds5000.bt</a>
	83973120 bytes, MD5 = ec84eeeb20fe77b758370d5e312e4a5e

</pre>
  <li>Start the emulator with the following command line:<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -X -b -D2 -M128 -d ds5000.bt -j vmsprite -o ''</b>

</pre>
</ol>

<p>
The first time you boot up with the disk image, you will be asked a number 
of questions regarding network settings. If you feel like entering correct 
values, then you should use the following:
<p>

<pre>
    Your machine's Ethernet address:    10:20:30:40:50:60
    Your machine's IP:                  10.0.0.1
    Subnet mask:                        0xff000000
    Gateway's Ethernet address:         60:50:40:30:20:10
    Gateway's IP:                       10.0.0.254
</pre>

<p>
Unfortunately, at the end of <a href="http://www.es.embnet.org/Services/ftp/misc/TUHS/sprite/boot.txt">
http://www.es.embnet.org/Services/ftp/misc/TUHS/sprite/boot.txt</a>, the 
following sad statement can be found:
<pre>
    The bootable Sprite image is meant to be a demonstration of Sprite, not
    a robust Sprite system.  There are several missing things, such as 
    floating point and network support.
</pre>

<p>
Once you are logged in as root, running <b>xinit</b> will start the X11 
environment.

<p>
Sprite works fine with dynamic binary translation (enabled by
adding <b>-b</b> to the command line options).

<h3>How to install Debian GNU/Linux for DECstation in the emulator:</h3>

<p>
<font color="#ff0000">NOTE: This is experimental, and <i>extremely</i>
unstable. During my tests, even pressing the wrong key during the install
(for example the wrong cursor key) can cause a kernel Oops.
I <i>think</i> this has to do with interrupts from the serial controller.
Hopefully using the -U command line option will reduce the risk for such 
crashes. (I haven't had time to come up with a clean solution to this yet;
it feels like a buffer overflow in Linux' serial driver for the 5000/200,
but it is also likely that it is a bug in mips64emul.)
</font>

<p>
The following steps should let you install Debian GNU/Linux for DECstation
onto a harddisk image:

<p>
<ol>
  <li>Compile mips64emul:<pre>
	$ <b>./configure; make</b>

</pre>
  <li>Create an empty harddisk image, which will be the root disk
	that Debian installs itself onto:<pre>
	$ <b>dd if=/dev/zero of=debian.img bs=1024 count=1 seek=2000000</b>

</pre>
  <li>Download an install kernel:<pre>
	<a href="http://http.us.debian.org/debian/dists/testing/main/installer-mipsel/current/images/r3k-kn02/boot.img">http://http.us.debian.org/debian/dists/testing/main/</a>

	or

</pre>
	depending on whether you want to install Debian "Testing" or
	"Unstable".
  <p>
  <li>For a text-mode installation, start the emulator like this:<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -D2 -b -U -M64 -o 'console=ttyS3' -d debian.img -O boot.img</b>

</pre>
</ol>

<p>
Debian GNU/Linux on DECstation works reasonably fine with dynamic
binary translation, enabled by the <b>-b</b> command line option. (Without
this option, the emulator might be less buggy, but also too slow to be 
useful when running Linux as a guest OS.)

<p>
(If you want to, you can try <b>-X</b> instead of <b>-o 'console=ttyS3'</b> on
the command line. This will cause Linux to use the graphical framebuffer.
Unfortunately, Linux does not seem to have a driver for the DZ11 keyboard
controller yet, so you cannot interact with the system. You will see the
penguin in the upper lefthand corner while booting, and nicely rendered Unicode
characters, but that's about it.)

<p>
You need to enter some values during the installation procedure, for example
network settings. The following should work:
<p>
<pre>
    DHCP:                       No, choose "Configure network manually"
    IP address:                 10.0.0.1
    Netmask:                    255.0.0.0
    Gateway:                    10.0.0.254
    Name server addresses:      10.0.0.254
</pre>

<p>
Once the first phase of the install has finished, the following command 
should let you boot into Debian, and perform post-install configuration:<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -D2 -U -b -M64 -o 'console=ttyS3' -d debian.img</b>

</pre>

<p>
It seems that there's a problem with getting a login prompt on serial 
console (at least when I've done test installs), so when the installation 
is finished and you're supposed to get a login prompt, you need to press 
CTRL-C and type <b>quit</b>, and then:

<p>
<ol start="5">
  <li>Download a normal kernel (not a RAMDISK one).<pre>
	<a href="http://http.us.debian.org/debian/dists/testing/main/installer-mipsel/current/images/cdrom/vmlinux-2.4.27-r3k-kn02">http://http.us.debian.org/debian/dists/testing/main/</a>

</pre>
  <li>Boot Debian using the following command line:<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -D2 -U -b -M64 -o 'console=ttyS3 root=/dev/sda1 rw
		init=/bin/sh' -d debian.img vmlinux-2.4.27-r3k-kn02</b>

</pre>
	You'll enter single-user mode. You need to add a line to
	/etc/inittab, to enable logins via serial console.<pre>
	sh-2.05b# <b>echo 'T3:23:respawn:/sbin/getty -L ttyS3 9600 vt100' >> /etc/inittab</b>
	sh-2.05b# <b>echo 'ttyS3' >> /etc/securetty</b>
	sh-2.05b# <b>sync; umount /</b>
</pre>
</ol>

<p>
The system should now be ready for everyday use.

<p>
Use this command to boot from the completely installed disk image:<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -D2 -U -b -M64 -o 'console=ttyS3' -d debian.img</b>

</pre>

<p>

Kaj-Michael Lang noticed that the current CVS-version of
<a href="http://www.linux-mips.org/">linux-mips</a> has

	19486676 bytes, md5 = 5bcb725c90209479cd7ead8ad0c4a414

</pre>
  <li>This is the tricky part: Create an ext2 filesystem image called redhat.img using
	the filesystem tree you just downloaded. The disk image should have a MS-DOS
	partition table (!), and then one or more ext2 partitions.
	(Use loopback mount, or similar. This is probably easiest to do on a Linux host.)
	However, in order to actually boot the system you need to modify /etc/fstab.
	Change<pre>
	/dev/root               /               nfs     defaults        1 1

</pre>(Note sda1 instead of sdc1.)
  <p>
  <li>To boot Linux, start the emulator like this:<pre>
	$ <b>./mips64emul -D2 -U -b -M128 -o "console=ttyS3 root=/dev/sda1 ro" -d redhat.img vmlinux-2.4.27-r3k-kn02</b>

</pre>

<p>
Redhat Linux on DECstation in R3000 mode should work fine with dynamic binary 
translation (enabled by the <b>-b</b> command line option).

<p>
NOTE: You can add <b>-X</b> and remove <b>console=ttyS3</b> from the command
line, if you want to use a graphical framebuffer. Unfortunately, Linux 
doesn't have support for keyboards on DECstation 5000/200 yet, so you cannot
