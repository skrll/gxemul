<p><br><h3><a name="whatisgxemul">What is GXemul?</a></h3>

<p>GXemul is an experimental framework for full-system 
emulation/simulation. Several <a href="machines.html">machines</a> 
and other <a href="components.html">components</a> that make up a computer 
system have been implemented, and the framework is designed so that it 
should be relatively easy to add new machine and component types.

<p>GXemul 0.5.0 is a complete rewrite of GXemul in C++.

<p>Thanks to (in no specific order) Ryan Blair, Hollis Blanchard, Joachim 
Buss, Olivier Houchard, Juli Mallett, Juan Romero Pardines, Carl van 
Schaik, Miod Vallat, Alec Voropay, Nils Weller, GÃ¶ran Weinholt, Alexander 
Yurchenko, and everyone else who has provided feedback on this and 
previous releases of GXemul.

<!--

<p>In addition to feedback, the following individuals have contributed
larger portions of code:

	<li>TODO.

<p>GXemul's homepage is <a href="http://gavare.se/gxemul/">http://gavare.se/gxemul/</a>.

<p>If you have questions about GXemul, please send mail to one of the
mailing lists: <a 
href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=gxemul-devel"><tt>gxemul-devel</tt></a>
for (technical) discussions about the development of GXemul, or <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=gxemul-users"><tt>gxemul-users</tt></a>
for general user questions.

<p>You may also join the IRC channel

<p><br><h3><a name="build">How to build/install GXemul</a></h3>

<p>If you are lucky, your OS vendor has already packaged GXemul for your
particular platform. If so, then please refer to your OS on how to
download/install GXemul. E.g. on <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>,
you would usually execute<pre>
	<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=pkg_add&apropos=0&sektion=0&format=html">pkg_add</a> -r <a href="http://www.freshports.org/emulators/gxemul/">gxemul</a>

	or

	cd <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/emulators/gxemul/">/usr/ports/emulators/gxemul</a>; make install
</pre>
as root. That will install GXemul, either as a pre-build binary package,
or from the <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/ports/">FreeBSD Ports system</a>.

<p>Another example is on <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux</a>,
where the corresponding command line is:<pre>
	apt-get install <a href="http://packages.debian.org/gxemul">gxemul</a>
</pre>

<p>However, there are several reasons why you might want to build
directly from source code:
<ul>
	<li>GXemul may not be available as a pre-built package for your OS.
	<li>GXemul may be available for your OS, but only an older version.
	<li>You simply feel like compiling from source code directly, perhaps
		because you want to modify the source code.
	<li>You may not have root access on your machine, so you cannot
		install the GXemul package from the OS vendor system-wide.
</ul>

<p>If you want to build from source code, you should
<a href="http://gavare.se/gxemul/download.html">download the GXemul 
distribution from the home page</a> and run:<pre>
	./configure
	make
</pre>

<p>This should work on most Unix-like platforms. If it does 
not work for you, then please mail me a detailed bug report, including
the output of <tt>uname -a</tt>, the <tt>configure</tt> and <tt>make</tt>
output, and any other useful information.
(Using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygwin">Cygwin</a>
might work as well, but this is not really supported.)

<p>This should work on most Unix-like systems. GXemul does not require any 
specific libraries to build, however, having the following libraries or tools available
adds features that are otherwise unavailable:
<ul>
  <li>X11, for graphical framebuffer emulation
  <li><tt>glibmm</tt>, for I18N support
  <li><tt>libintl</tt>, for I18N support
  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxygen">Doxygen</a>, 
		for building <a href="doxygen/html/index.html">C++ class documentation</a>.
</ul>

<p>These are <i>optional</i> dependencies. GXemul will build and run without
them. If Doxygen is missing, the installed documentation will not include the
<a href="doxygen/html/index.html">source code reference</a>.

<p>If the build succeeded, you will end up with a <tt>gxemul</tt> binary.
This should work fine stand-alone, and does not have to be
installed anywhere, but for convenience, there is a
<tt>make install</tt> target which installs the binary and other files.





<p><br><h3><a name="free">Is GXemul Free software?</a></h3>

Yes. GXemul is released under a Free license. The code in GXemul is
Copyrighted software, it is <i>not</i> public domain. (If this is
confusing to you, you might want to read up on the definitions of the
four freedoms associated with Free software, <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html</a>.)

<p>Most of the code is released under a 3-clause BSD-style license
(or "revised BSD-style" if one wants to use <a 
href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/bsd.html">GNU jargon</a>). Apart from
the main code, some files are copied from other sources such as
NetBSD, for example header files containing symbolic names of bitfields in
device registers. They are also covered by similar licenses, but with some
additional clauses. The main point, however, is that the licenses require
that the original Copyright and license terms are included when you make a
copy or modification.

<p>If you plan to redistribute GXemul <i>without</i> supplying the source
code, then you need to comply with each individual source file some other
way, for example by writing additional documentation containing copyright
notes. (This is not done in the default distribution, since it is a source 
code distribution. You need to check 
all individual files for details. The <i>easiest way out</i> if you plan 
to redistribute code from GXemul is, of course, to let it remain Free Software
and simply include the source code.)

<p>In case you want to reuse parts of GXemul, but you need to do that 
under a different license (e.g. the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GPL</a>), then contact
the author of the files in question to see if the files can be
dual-licensed.
