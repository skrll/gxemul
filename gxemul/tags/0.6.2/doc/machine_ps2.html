<p>The PlayStation 2 emulation is <font color="red">not working yet</font>. The focus is
not on making an emulator for running games, as there are other emulators
for that, but rather on making it possible to run NetBSD/playstation2. This page
contains <i>preliminary instructions</i> for how to experiment with NetBSD.</p>

<h3>NetBSD/playstation2:</h3>

<p><font color="red">NOTE: This doesn't work, and the <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/ports/playstation2/">playstation2 port of NetBSD</a> is not active at the time of writing this.</font>

<p>It was removed from NetBSD's tree in 2009, although a <a href="https://blog.netbsd.org/tnf/entry/the_playstation2_port_is_back">blog post from 2014</a> indicates
that it could possibly be brought back to life.

<a href="20190616-netbsd-playstation2-userland.png"><img src="20190616-netbsd-playstation2-userland-small.png"></a>

<p>To attempt to run the latest snapshot (from 2002):


<p>
<ol>
  <li>Create an empty harddisk image, which will be the root disk
	that the guest OS installs itself onto:<pre>
	<b>dd if=/dev/zero of=nbsd_playstation2.img bs=1024 count=1 seek=3900000</b>

</pre>
  <li>Download <a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/playstation2/snapshot/20020327/binary/kernel/netbsd-GENERIC.gz">ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/playstation2/snapshot/20020327/binary/kernel/netbsd-GENERIC.gz</a> and run<pre>
	<b>gxemul -X -E playstation2 -d nbsd_playstation2.img netbsd-GENERIC.gz</b>
</pre>
</ol>

<p>Then it hangs, waiting for keyboard input from a keyboard which doesn't exist,
in order to select the root device.

<p><font color="red">As a horrible hack, which probably doesn't really work,</font>
one could imagine setting <tt>root_device</tt> and
<tt>rootdev</tt> manually. For example:

<ul>
	<li>Run with <tt>-p wdattach</tt> and get the second argument to that
		function (register a1).
	<li>Run again with <tt>-p setroot</tt>, and type something like:<pre>
&lt;setroot&gt;
ffffffff8002ad98: 27bdff20      addiu   sp,sp,-224
BREAKPOINT: pc = 0xffffffff8002ad98
(The instruction has not yet executed.)

GXemul> <b>put w root_device, 0xffffffffc0016800</b>		&lt;-- the a1 value from wdattach
GXemul> <b>put w rootdev, 0x100</b>				&lt;-- ???

GXemul> <b>pc=ra</b>						&lt;-- to return from setroot without
GXemul> <b>co</b>						    keyboard interaction
</pre>
</ul>

<p>But there are timeouts and lost interrupts, so even if a correct disk image
was used, and the correct <tt>rootdev</tt> value was used, it is unlikely that
it would work yet.
