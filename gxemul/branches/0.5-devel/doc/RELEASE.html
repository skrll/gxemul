<h2>Release notes for GXemul 0.5.0</h2>

<p><i>Copyright (C) 2003-2009  Anders Gavare</i>


<p><br>GXemul is a framework for full-system computer architecture
emulation/simulation.

<p><br>The changes between release 0.4.7 and 0.5.0 are:

<ul>

  <li>A complete redesign of the emulation framework has begun.
	The new framework is written in C++, and should hopefully
	be a more robust and extensible platform than the old one was.

	<p>Some of the highlights:
	<ul>
		<li>A much more general view of what an emulated "component" is
			than before, allowing for more complex emulation setups,
			for example mixing different CPU architectures within
			a machine.
		<li>Unit tests for most of the functionality.
	</ul>

	<p>
	(Since this is such a huge undertaking, only very few actual
	emulation modes have been reimplemented to
	use the new framework. GXemul 0.4.x is of course still available
	for download, if you need emulation modes or features from
	those versions.)
  <p>
  <li>Initial I18N support. Apart from English, there is now
	also a Swedish translation.
  <p>
  <li>There is now (finally) a 'make install' Makefile target.

</ul>

<p>Please read the HISTORY file for more details.


<p><br>Files included in this release are:<pre>
    HISTORY                      Detailed revision history / changelog.
    LICENSE                      Copyright message / license.
    README                       Quick start instructions, for the impatient.
    configure, Makefile.skel     sh and make scripts for building GXemul.
    demos/                       Tutorial-like demos of testmachine functionality.
    <a href="index.html">doc/</a>                         Documentation.
    experiments/                 Experimental code. (Usually not needed.)
    man/                         Man page.
    src/                         Source code.
</pre>

<p>To build the emulator, run the <tt>configure</tt> script, and then run 
<tt>make</tt>. This should work on most Unix-like systems, with few or no 
modifications to the source code.

<p>Regarding files in the <a href="../src/include/thirdparty"><tt>src/include/thirdparty</tt></a>
directory: these
are imported from other sources, such as NetBSD. The license texts usually
say that "All advertising materials mentioning features 
or use of this software" must display acknowledgements. Even though I do 
not feel that I mention features or use of the header files (the
"software") in any advertising materials, I am still very grateful for the 
fact that these people have made their files available for re-use, as Free 
software, so regardless of legal requirements, I guess thanking them like 
this is in order:<pre>
    GXemul uses Wu Yongwei's C++ new/delete memory leak detector.

    This product includes software developed by Nivas Madhur.

    This product includes software developed by the NetBSD
    Foundation, Inc. and its contributors.

    Carnegie Mellon University   (multiple header files,
    no specific advertisement text required)
</pre>

<p>Please see individual files for license details, if you plan to redistribute
GXemul in binary form, or reuse code.
