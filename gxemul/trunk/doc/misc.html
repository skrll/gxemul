<a name="accuracy"></a>
<h3>Emulation accuracy:</h3>

<p>GXemul is an instruction-level emulator; things that would happen in
several steps within a real CPU are not taken into account (e.g. pipe-line
stalls or out-of-order execution). Still, instruction-level accuracy seems
to be enough to be able to run complete guest operating systems inside the
emulator.

<p>The existance of instruction and data caches is "faked" to let
operating systems think that they are there, but for all practical
purposes, these caches are non-working.

<p>The emulator is in general <i>not</i> timing-accurate, neither at the
instruction level nor on any higher level. An attempt is made to let
emulated clocks run at the same speed as the host (i.e. an emulated timer
running at 100 Hz will interrupt around 100 times per real second), but
since the host speed may vary, e.g. because of other running processes,
there is no guarantee as to how many instructions will be executed in
each of these 100 Hz cycles.

<p>If the host is very slow, the emulated clocks might even lag behind
the real-world clock.

<a name="devel"></a>
<h3>Writing operating system code, or developing firmware, using GXemul:</h3>

<p>Is this a good idea? The answer is yes and no, depending on the level of
detail you need in your simulations. Important things to keep in mind are:

<ul>
	<li>Porting code to a specific machine mode, e.g. a Silicon Graphics
	machine, using GXemul, will not "magically" cause the code to
	work on a real machine. You still need to test it on real hardware.
	Sometimes code works in GXemul which doesn't
	work on real hardware, sometimes it's the other way around.

	<p>
	<li>GXemul contains bugs, and many things are not yet implemented.

	<p>
	<li><b>Very important!</b> I have only implemented devices in GXemul
	to the degree that NetBSD, OpenBSD, Linux, etc don't complain too much.
	<p>
	If you are developing a driver for a device which is emulated by
	GXemul, and your driver does not seem to be working, it could just
	as well be that the fault is in GXemul's implementation of
	the device, and not a bug in your driver.
	<p>
	The device implementations in GXemul are mostly based on the assumption
	that the emulated OS is already developed and bug-free. They are
	not primarily intended to be used for development of new device
	driver code in operating systems, so if you do that, then be
	prepared for bugs and inconsitencies, and (as mentioned before) make
	sure to also run your code or real hardware.
	<p>
	<li>CPU details in GXemul are sometimes wrong. If your code depends
	on specific details of a particular CPU implementation, chances
	area that GXemul will not be sufficient. One example is different
	revisions of ISAs: some instructions which should trigger an exception
	on a real MIPS processor may execute anyway in GXemul.
	<p>
	<li>Caches. There is no cache emulation in GXemul right now. Caches
	for R2000/R3000 are faked well enough to run NetBSD, Ultrix, etc
	in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DECstation">DECstation</a>
	emulation mode, but other than that, cache operations are treated as
	nops. So for example after you have loaded machine code into RAM in
	order to execute it, you probably need to flush/clear the instruction
	cache before branching to the code. A failure to flush the instruction
	cache would likely result in buggy/random behavior on real hardware
	whereas the code would still run in GXemul.
</ul>

<p>The bottom line is that GXemul can be useful as a <i>complement</i> to testing
your code on real hardware, but it should not be fully relied on.






<p><br>
<a name="compilercontruct"></a>
<h3>Using GXemul in compiler contruction courses:</h3>

<p>If you are learning how to write a compiler, and wish to target a 
realistic target platform, then MIPS or ARM (as emulated by GXemul)
might be suitable choices.

<p>Your compiler needs to output real assembly
language code, which the assembler (e.g. gas, the GNU assembler) can 
then compile into object format, and then you need to link this
into an executable image. This is much closer to how things work
in real life than running assembly language listings in a simulator
(e.g. <a href="http://spimsimulator.sourceforge.net/">SPIM</a>).

<p>
However, GXemul does not simulate
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-order_execution">out-of-order
execution</a>, penalties related to instruction scheduling, or
load-delays, so it cannot be used to evaluate optimizing compilers
that take advantage of such processor features. GXemul keeps
track of the number of instructions executed, but that's it.





<p><br>
<a name="disk"></a>
<h3>How to start the emulator with a disk image:</h3>

<p>Add <i>-d [prefixes:]diskimagefilename</i> to the command line, where prefixes
are one or more single-character options. Run <b>gxemul -h</b>
to get a list of possible options.

<p>Here are some examples. If you want to run a <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/ports/pmax/">NetBSD/pmax</a>
kernel on an emulated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DECstation">DECstation</a>
machine, you would use a command line such as this:
<pre>
	$ <b>gxemul -e 3max -d pmax_diskimage.fs netbsd-pmax-INSTALL</b>
</pre>

<p>NOTE: For some emulation modes, such as the DECstation mode, you do 
<i>not</i> actually have to specify the name of the kernel, if the disk 
image is bootable!

<p>It is possible to have more than one disk. For each -d argument, a disk
image is added; the first will be SCSI target 0, the second will be target 1, and so on,
unless you specify explicitly which ID number the devices should have.
<pre>
	$ <b>gxemul -e 3max -d disk0.raw -d disk1.raw -d 5:disk2.raw netbsd-pmax-INSTALL</b>
</pre>

<p>Note: In the example above, disk2.raw will get scsi id 5.

<p>If a filename has a 'c' prefix, or ends with ".iso", then it is assumed to be
a CDROM device (this can be overridden with a 'd' prefix, to force a read/write disk).
For example, the following command would start the emulator with two
CDROM images, and one harddisk image:
<pre>
	$ <b>gxemul -e 3max -d image.iso -d disk0.img -d c:second_cdrom.img netbsd-pmax-INSTALL</b>
</pre>

<p>Usually, the device with the lowest id becomes the boot device. To override
this, add a 'b' prefix to one of the devices:
<pre>
	$ <b>gxemul -e 3max -d rootdisk.img -d bc:install-cd.iso name_of_kernel</b>
</pre>

<p>If you have a physical CD-ROM drive on the host machine, say /dev/cd0c, you can
use it as a CD-ROM directly accessible from within the emulator:
<pre>
	$ <b>gxemul -e 3max -d rootdisk.img -d bc:/dev/cd0c name_of_kernel</b>
</pre>

<p>It is probably possible to use harddisks as well this way, but I would not
recommend it.






<p><br>
<a name="tape_images"></a>
<h3>How to start the emulator with tape images:</h3>

<p>Using emulated tape drives is a bit more complicated than disks, because a
tape can be made up of several "files" with space in between. The solution
I have choosen is to have one file in the host's file system space for each
tape file. The prefix for using tapes is 't', and the filename given is
for the <i>first</i> file on that tape (number zero, implicitly). For
files following file nr 0, a dot and the filenumber is appended to the
filename.
<p>
As an example, starting the emulator with
<pre>
	<b>-d t4:mytape.img</b>
</pre>
<p>will cause SCSI id 4 to be a tape device, using the following file number
to name translation scheme:
<p>
<center>
 <table border="0">
  <tr>
    <td><b>File number:</b></td>
    <td><b>File name in the host's filesystem:</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">0</td>
    <td align="left">mytape.img</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">1</td>
    <td align="left">mytape.img.1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">2</td>
    <td align="left">mytape.img.2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">..</td>
    <td align="left">..</td>
  </tr>
 </table>
</center>
<p>
If you already have a number of tape files, which should be placed on the
same emulated tape, then you might not want to rename all those files.
Use symbolic links instead (ln -s).
<p>
There is another advantage to using symbolic links for tape filenames:
every time a tape is rewound, it is reopened using the filename given
on the command line. By changing what the symbolic name points to,
you can "switch tapes" without quiting and restarting the emulator.

<p>
<font color="#ff0000">Note: Tape support is most likely very buggy, 
because it has not been tested much, and has probably also suffered 
from bit-rot by now.</font>






<p><br>
<a name="disk_overlays"></a>
<h3>How to use disk image overlays:</h3>

<p>This is most likely best understood by an example:

<p><ul>
  <li>Install e.g. <a href="machine_cats.html#netbsdcatsinstall">NetBSD/cats</a>.
	You will end up with a disk image called
	<tt>nbsd_cats.img</tt>.
  <p>
  <li>Running the following command will boot straight from the disk
	image, with no overlay images:<pre>
	<b>gxemul -XEcats -d nbsd_cats.img netbsd.aout-GENERIC.gz</b>

</pre>
  <li>You may now create an overlay file, a corresponding map file,
	and start the emulator with the overlay image connected to
	the same (explicit) ID as the base disk image:<pre>
	<b>touch overlay.img overlay.img.map
	gxemul -XEcats -d 0:nbsd_cats.img -d V0:overlay.img netbsd.aout-GENERIC.gz</b>

</pre>
  <li>Any changes to the filesystem you perform when using the overlay
	will only be written to that overlay. For example, to perform
	a "roll back", you can do the following:<pre>
	<b>rm -f overlay.img overlay.img.map
	touch overlay.img overlay.img.map</b>

</pre>
	and then simply start the emulator again, with the newly created
	overlay image.
</ul>

<p>It is also possible to add multiple overlays. In that case, writes 
always go the the <i>last</i> added overlay.

<p>GXemul uses Unix' way of supporting files with "holes",
so even if <tt>ls -l overlay.img</tt> says that the overlay is several 
gigabytes large, <tt>du overlay.img</tt> should reveal that only the
blocks that have actually been written to have been stored in the
overlay, e.g.:<pre>
	<b>$ ls -l
	..
	-rw-r--r--  1 debug  wheel  3072319488 Mar 24 11:59 nbsd_cats.img
	-rw-r--r--  1 debug  wheel     2465354 Mar 24 11:44 netbsd.aout-GENERIC.gz
	-rw-r--r--  1 debug  wheel  2930841600 Mar 24 14:02 overlay.img
	-rw-r--r--  1 debug  wheel      715538 Mar 24 14:02 overlay.img.map
	$ du overlay.img
	864     overlay.img
</b>
</pre>

<p>The .map file is simply a raw bitmap telling which blocks of the 
overlay file that are in use.





<p><br>
<a name="filexfer"></a>
<h3>Transfering files to/from the guest OS:</h3>

<p>If the emulated machine supports networking (see <a 
href="networking.html#intro">this section</a> for more info), then the easiest
way to transfer files is probably to use FTP or similar methods.

<p>There is another way of transfering files which works for any kind of 
emulated machine which supports disks (either SCSI or IDE). Any file can 
be supplied as a disk image. For example, consider the following:<pre>
	$ <b>gxemul -XEcats -d nbsd_cats.img -d archive.tar.gz netbsd-GENERIC</b>
</pre>
<p>This will start NetBSD/cats with <tt>nbsd_cats.img</tt> as IDE master on
controller 0 (wd0), and <tt>archive.tar.gz</tt> as IDE slave on controller
0 (wd1). From inside NetBSD, it is now possible to extract the files using 
the following command:<pre>
	(inside emulated NetBSD/cats)
	# <b>tar zxvf /dev/wd1c</b>
</pre>
<p>Don't worry if NetBSD complains about lack of disklabel; it doesn't
matter. On some machines, NetBSD uses <tt>wd1d</tt> instead of 
<tt>wd1c</tt> for the entire disk.
There is also a minor problem: reading the end of the disk image. If you 
experience problems untaring archives like this, then pad out the archive 
first with some zeroes.

<p>Transfering files <i>out</i> from the emulated operating system to the 
host can be done the same way. First, prepare an empty archive file:<pre>
	$ <b>dd if=/dev/zero of=newarchive.tar bs=1024 count=1 seek=10000</b>
</pre>
<p>This example created a 10 MB empty file. Then, start the emulator
like this:<pre>
	$ <b>gxemul -XEcats -d nbsd_cats.img -d archive.tar netbsd-GENERIC</b>
</pre>
<p>and transfer files by creating an archive directly onto the disk image:<pre>
	(inside emulated NetBSD/cats)
	# <b>tar cvf /dev/wd1c filenames</b>
</pre>
<p>where filenames are the files or directories to transfer.





<p><br>
<a name="largeimages"></a>
<h3>How to extract large gzipped disk images:</h3>

<p>Unix filesystems usually support large files with "holes". Holes are 
zero-filled blocks that don't actually exist on disk. This is very 
practical for emulated disk images, as it is possible to create a very 
large disk image without using up much space at all.

<p>
Using gzip and gunzip on disk images can be <i>very</i> slow, as these 
files can be multiple gigabytes large, but this is usually necessary for
transfering disk images over the internet. If you receive a gzipped disk 
image, say disk.img.gz, and run a naive
<p>
<pre>
	$ <b>gunzip disk.img.gz</b>
</pre>
<p>
on it, you will not end up with an optimized file unless 
gunzip supports that. (In my experiments, it doesn't.)  In plain English, 
if you type <b>ls -l</b> and the filesize is 9 GB, it will actually occupy 
9 GB of disk space! This is often unacceptable.
<p>
Using a simple tool which only writes blocks that are non-zero, a lot of 
space can be saved. Compile the program cp_removeblocks in the 
experiments/ directory, and type:
<p>
<pre>
	$ <b>gunzip -c disk.img.gz | cp_removeblocks /dev/stdin disk.img</b>
</pre>

<p>
This will give you a disk.img which looks like it is 9 GB, and works like
the real file, but the holes are not written out to the disk. (You can see
this by running for example <b>du disk.img</b> to see the physical block
count.)






<p><br>
<a name="promdump"></a>
<h3>Using a PROM dump from a real machine:</h3>

<p>In GXemul, a simple PROM/BIOS implementation is usually faked, so that
guest operating systems can start up. For example, if the PROM has services
which the guest OS can call, which tell how much memory there is in a
machine, or to print simple characters to a terminal, those can be
implemented in software without having to run the original PROM image from
a physical machine.

<p>
Raw PROM images from real machines can, in a few cases, be used in
the emulator. A few things are worth keeping in mind, though:

<ol>
	<li>ROM code is usually much more sensitive to correctness
	of the emulator than operating system kernels or userland programs
	are, so don't expect any PROM image to just magically work.
	<ul>
		<li>In particular, for proprietary hardware, a guest OS such
		as NetBSD or Linux may only use the parts of the hardware
		that have been reverse-engineered, whereas PROM firmware
		code will access other devices, or more device registers,
		and assume that the hardware works to a larger degree than
		NetBSD or Linux needs.
	</ul>
	<li>If you are running a <i>modified</i> ROM/firmware image in GXemul,
	in order to see that it boots up and works, it will not automatically
	mean that it will behave the same way when you put it back in real
	hardware again.
	<li>Most of the legacy modes of GXemul have been designed to
	run without the need for a PROM image, for example the load order
	(or mechanism) used to boot from a CDROM or SCSI disk, so running
	with actual machine firmware might not really be supported, more
	than for simple experiments.
</ol>

<p>
Useful command line options:

<p>
<ul>
	<li><tt>-Q</tt> disables the software/builtin PROM emulation in GXemul.
	<li><tt>-T</tt> stops the emulation in case the PROM tries to access
		a memory range which does not exist. (Default behavior is to
		ignore writes and return 0 on reads.)
	<li><tt>-K</tt> attempts to drop you into the debugger prompt, instead
		of quitting, on some errors.
	<li><tt>-v</tt> enables verbose output. In particular, it shows the
		output of any <tt>debug()</tt> calls in the code.
</ul>



<h4>Preparation:</h4>

<p>The ROM image first needs to be extracted from your real machine. There are
several ways to do this, and it depends on your available hardware, the
specifics of the machine in question, and how much time you have.

<p>
<ul>
  <li>Hook up a serial console and dump using the PROM's own dump
	command. On machines for which you need to use a serial console to
	access anyway, this is probably the easiest. The syntax for the
	dump commands vary between machines, and you often need to do some
	kind of post-processing to convert the dumped data (e.g. in some
	kind of hex dump text format) to a raw binary. Alternatively, you
	may be able to run a small program on the machine, which dumps
	suitable memory ranges to a serial port. There are some examples in
	the <tt>experiments/</tt> subdirectory which may help with these
	tasks.
  <li>Use hardware to read the PROM chip(s) directly.
	Not easy if you don't have such a hardware reader.
  <li>Copy the PROM memory range into a file, from a running
	operating system. You need a running OS, and it must
	have access to the PROM memory range. NetBSD, for example,
	doesn't allow that from userland, as far as I have understood,
	but a modified NetBSD kernel could probably allow this.
  <li>Dump the ROM contents "visually", by showing the individual bits on
	a display. Then use e.g. a webcam to record the images, and write a
	program which decodes them into plain data. This can be used for
	example on the Dreamcast, if you do not want to build a serial cable,
	and do not have a PROM chip reader.
</ul>
