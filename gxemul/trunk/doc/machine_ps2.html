<p>The PlayStation 2 emulation is not really working yet. The focus is
not on making an emulator for running games (there are other emulators
for that), but rather on making NetBSD/playstation2 run. This page
contains <i>preliminary instructions</i> for how to experiment with NetBSD.</p>

<h3>NetBSD/playstation2:</h3>

<p><font color="red">NOTE: This doesn't work, and the <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/ports/playstation2/">playstation2 port of NetBSD</a> is dead at the time of writing this.</font>

<p>It was removed from NetBSD's tree in 2009, although a <a href="https://blog.netbsd.org/tnf/entry/the_playstation2_port_is_back">blog post from 2014</a> indicates
that it could possibly be brought back to life.

<p>To attempt to run the latest snapshot (from 2002):


<p>
<ol>
  <li>Create an empty harddisk image, which will be the root disk
	that the guest OS installs itself onto:<pre>
	<b>dd if=/dev/zero of=nbsd_playstation2.img bs=1024 count=1 seek=3900000</b>

</pre>
  <li>Download <a href="ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/playstation2/snapshot/20020327/binary/kernel/netbsd-GENERIC.gz">ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/playstation2/snapshot/20020327/binary/kernel/netbsd-GENERIC.gz</a> and run<pre>
	<b>gxemul -X -E playstation2 -d nbsd_playstation2.img netbsd-GENERIC.gz</b>
</pre>
</ol>

<p>Supplying a disk image with <tt>-d</tt> almost works. Then it hangs, waiting for
keyboard input from a keyboard which doesn't exist.
