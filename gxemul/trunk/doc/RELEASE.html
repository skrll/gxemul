<h1>Release notes for GXemul 0.6.0.2</h1>

<p><i>Copyright (C) 2003-2018  Anders Gavare</i>

<p><br>GXemul is a framework for full-system computer architecture emulation. 
Several processor architectures and machine types have been implemented. 
It is working well enough to allow <a href="guestoses.html">unmodified
"guest" operating systems to run inside the emulator</a>,
as if they were running on real hardware.

<p>The emulator emulates (networks of) real machines. The machines may consist
of ARM, MIPS, Motorola 88K, PowerPC, and SuperH processors, and various 
surrounding hardware components such as framebuffers, busses, interrupt 
controllers, ethernet controllers, disk controllers, and serial port 
controllers.

<p>The <a href="index.html">documentation</a> lists the machines and
guest operating systems that 
can be regarded as "working" in GXemul. The first guest operating 
system that worked in GXemul is
<a href="guestoses.html#netbsdpmaxinstall">NetBSD/pmax</a>, and that is
still one of the guest OSes that works best.



<p><br>The changes between release 0.6.0.2 and 0.6.0.1 are relatively
minor. They include:

<p>General:
<ul>
	<li>Minor fixes to make it possible to build GXemul using
		relatively modern compilers (GCC 6.4.0 and clang 3.4.1).
	<li>Updating the guest OS installation
		instructions with newer versions of guest OSes.
</ul>

<p>Old framework:
<ul>
	<li><b>MIPS:</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Bug fix for the case when a guest OS used larger-than-4KB
			pages, when it comes to invalidating previous
			translations. This makes e.g. recent versions of
			<a href="unsupported.html#helenosmaltabe">HelenOS
			on Malta</a> run further than before.
	</ul>
</ul>

<p>New framework:
<ul>	
	<li><b>Intel i960:</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Disassembly of i960CA instructions has been
			implemented. Execution is not implemented yet,
			but disassembly support may still be useful when
			debugging or inspecting i960 binaries.
		<li>Intel b.out file format loader.
	</ul>
</ul>



<p><br>Please read the HISTORY file for more details.

<p>To build the emulator, run the <tt>configure</tt> script, and then run 
<tt>make</tt>. This should hopefully work on most Unix-like systems, with few
or no modifications to the source code.

<p>Regarding files in the <tt>src/include/</tt> directory: only some of 
these are written by me, the rest are from other sources
(such as <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a>). See individual
source files for details, if you plan to redistribute GXemul or reuse code.
