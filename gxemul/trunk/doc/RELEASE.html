<h1>Release notes for GXemul 0.7.1</h1>

<p><i>Copyright (C) 2003-2021  Anders Gavare</i>

<p><br>GXemul is a framework for full-system computer architecture emulation. 
Several processor architectures and machine types have been implemented. 
It is working well enough to allow unmodified "guest" operating systems to run
inside the emulator, as if they were running on real hardware.

<p>The emulator emulates (networks of) real machines. The machines may consist
of ARM, MIPS, Motorola 88K, PowerPC, and SuperH processors, and various 
surrounding hardware components such as framebuffers, busses, interrupt 
controllers, ethernet controllers, disk controllers, and serial port 
controllers.


<p><br>The changes between release 0.7.0 and 0.7.1 include:
<ul>
	<li>...
</ul>


<p><br>Please read the HISTORY file for more details.

<p>Regarding files in the <tt>src/include/thirdparty/</tt> directory:
most of these are from other open source projects such as NetBSD. See individual
source files for details, if you plan to redistribute GXemul in binary form,
or reuse the source code.
