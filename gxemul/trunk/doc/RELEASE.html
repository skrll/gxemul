<h1>Release notes for GXemul 0.6.3</h1>

<p><i>Copyright (C) 2003-2021  Anders Gavare</i>

<p><br>GXemul is a framework for full-system computer architecture emulation. 
Several processor architectures and machine types have been implemented. 
It is working well enough to allow unmodified
"guest" operating systems to run inside the emulator,
as if they were running on real hardware.

<p>The emulator emulates (networks of) real machines. The machines may consist
of ARM, MIPS, Motorola 88K, PowerPC, and SuperH processors, and various 
surrounding hardware components such as framebuffers, busses, interrupt 
controllers, ethernet controllers, disk controllers, and serial port 
controllers.

<p>The documentation <a href="intro.html#emulmodes">lists the machines and
guest operating systems</a> that can be regarded as "working" in GXemul.
The first guest operating system that worked in GXemul was
<a href="machine_decstation.html#netbsdpmaxinstall">NetBSD/pmax</a> on
an emulated DECstation 5000/200, and that is
still one of the guest OSes that works best.



<p><br>The most important changes between release 0.6.2 and 0.6.3 are:

<ul>
	<li><a href="machine_luna88k.html#openbsdluna88k">OpenBSD/luna88k can now run in GXemul</a> with root-on-nfs.
		The installation instructions are somewhat involved, but
		it works well enough to self-compile at least an older
		version of GXemul inside OpenBSD running in the emulator.

	<p>
	<li><a href="networking.html#tap">/dev/tap devices in the host can now be used for networking</a>.
		(Patch contributed by Jason Thorpe.)

	<p>
	<li>A bug which caused reads at the end of files supplied as
		disk images to fail has been fixed.
		Usage of tar archives for passing files to and from
		emulated machines that lack networking capability is thus
		somewhat less buggy.

	<p>
	<li>... and various other bugfixes.
</ul>



<p><br>Please read the HISTORY file for more details.

<p>To build the emulator, run the <tt>configure</tt> script, and then run 
<tt>make</tt>. This should hopefully work on most Unix-like systems, with few
or no modifications to the source code.

<p>Regarding files in the <tt>src/include/thirdparty/</tt> directory:
most of these are from other open source projects such as NetBSD. See individual
source files for details, if you plan to redistribute GXemul in binary form,
or reuse the source code.
