<h1>Release notes for GXemul 0.6.2</h1>

<p><i>Copyright (C) 2003-2019  Anders Gavare</i>

<p><br>GXemul is a framework for full-system computer architecture emulation. 
Several processor architectures and machine types have been implemented. 
It is working well enough to allow unmodified
"guest" operating systems to run inside the emulator,
as if they were running on real hardware.

<p>The emulator emulates (networks of) real machines. The machines may consist
of ARM, MIPS, Motorola 88K, PowerPC, and SuperH processors, and various 
surrounding hardware components such as framebuffers, busses, interrupt 
controllers, ethernet controllers, disk controllers, and serial port 
controllers.

<p>The <a href="index.html">documentation</a> lists the machines and
guest operating systems that 
can be regarded as "working" in GXemul. The first guest operating 
system that worked in GXemul was
<a href="machine_decstation.html#netbsdpmaxinstall">NetBSD/pmax</a> on
an emulated DECstation 5000/200, and that is
still one of the guest OSes that works best.



<p><br>The most important changes between release 0.6.1 and 0.6.2 are:

<ul>
	<li>When writing to mirrored RAM ranges, any dyntrans translations
		made in either the mirror or the mirrored ranges are
		now invalidated. This means that an emulated SGI O2 can 
		now be used with up to 1 GB of RAM when
		running OpenBSD/sgi as a guest OS. Previously, 256 MB
		was the maximum amount of emulated RAM possible for
		the SGI O2.

	<p>
	<li>Cleanup: The MIPS processor emulation implemented in the
		"new framework", and the corresponding MIPS machine 
		modes in the new framework, have been removed. (All
		meaningful MIPS emulation is in the old framework anyway.)

	<p>
	<li>Various minor updates to the documentation to make it
		easier to read and more up to date; less focus on
		the "new framework"; more focus on <a href="intro.html#emulmodes">individual
		emulated machine types</a> rather than just having a
		long unsorted list of guest OS installation instructions;
		and an introduction to <a href="debugging.html">using
		GXemul as a debugger</a>.
</ul>



<p><br>Please read the HISTORY file for more details.

<p>To build the emulator, run the <tt>configure</tt> script, and then run 
<tt>make</tt>. This should hopefully work on most Unix-like systems, with few
or no modifications to the source code.

<p>Regarding files in the <tt>src/include/thirdparty/</tt> directory:
most of these are from other open source projects such as NetBSD. See individual
source files for details, if you plan to redistribute GXemul in binary form,
or reuse the source code.
