<h1>Release notes for GXemul 0.6.1</h1>

<p><i>Copyright (C) 2003-2018  Anders Gavare</i>

<p><br>GXemul is a framework for full-system computer architecture emulation. 
Several processor architectures and machine types have been implemented. 
It is working well enough to allow <a href="guestoses.html">unmodified
"guest" operating systems to run inside the emulator</a>,
as if they were running on real hardware.

<p>The emulator emulates (networks of) real machines. The machines may consist
of ARM, MIPS, Motorola 88K, PowerPC, and SuperH processors, and various 
surrounding hardware components such as framebuffers, busses, interrupt 
controllers, ethernet controllers, disk controllers, and serial port 
controllers.

<p>The <a href="index.html">documentation</a> lists the machines and
guest operating systems that 
can be regarded as "working" in GXemul. The first guest operating 
system that worked in GXemul is
<a href="guestoses.html#netbsdpmaxinstall">NetBSD/pmax</a>, and that is
still one of the guest OSes that works best.



<p><br>The main change between release 0.6.1 and 0.6.0.x is:

<ul>
	TODO.
</ul>



<p><br>Please read the HISTORY file for more details.

<p><br>Files included in this release are:<pre>
    HISTORY                       Detailed revision history / changelog.
    LICENSE                       Copyright message / license.
    README                        Quick start instructions, for the impatient.
    configure, Makefile.skel      sh and make scripts for building GXemul.
    demos/                        Tutorial-like demos of testmachine functionality.
    <a href="index.html">doc/</a>                          Documentation.
    doc/RELEASE.html              This file.
    <a href="TODO.html">doc/TODO</a>                      TODO notes.
    experiments/                  Experimental code. (Usually not needed.)
    man/                          Man page.
    src/                          Source code.
    test/                         Files used for testing.
</pre>

<p>To build the emulator, run the <tt>configure</tt> script, and then run 
<tt>make</tt>. This should hopefully work on most Unix-like systems, with few
or no modifications to the source code.

<p>Regarding files in the <tt>src/include/</tt> directory: only some of 
these are written by me, the rest are from other sources
(such as <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a>). See individual
source files for details, if you plan to redistribute GXemul or reuse code.

<p>GXemul's homepage is
