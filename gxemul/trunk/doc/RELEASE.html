<h1>Release notes for GXemul 0.7.0</h1>

<p><i>Copyright (C) 2003-2021  Anders Gavare</i>

<p><br>GXemul is a framework for full-system computer architecture emulation. 
Several processor architectures and machine types have been implemented. 
It is working well enough to allow unmodified
"guest" operating systems to run inside the emulator,
as if they were running on real hardware.

<p>The emulator emulates (networks of) real machines. The machines may consist
of ARM, MIPS, Motorola 88K, PowerPC, and SuperH processors, and various 
surrounding hardware components such as framebuffers, busses, interrupt 
controllers, ethernet controllers, disk controllers, and serial port 
controllers.
The documentation <a href="intro.html#emulmodes">lists the machines and
guest operating systems</a> that can be regarded as working in GXemul.




<p><br>The most important changes between release 0.6.3.1 and 0.7.0 are:
<ul>
	<li>...
	
	<p>
	<li>Output from the emulator is now subtly colorized, to make it
		easier to quickly interpret the text. (This can be disabled
		using <tt>-A</tt>.)
</ul>

<p>The source code is also switched back from C++ to plain C:
<ul>
	<li>The "new" framework was removed. Instead of two different emulators
		in the same program, there's just the traditional emulation
		framework.
	<li>A C compiler supporting the C99 standard is needed in
		order to build GXemul.
	<li>For third parties that package GXemul (e.g. for package managing
		systems used by operating systems or distributions),
		build scripts may need to be modified:
	<ul>
		<li>The unit tests (<tt>make test</tt>) are gone.
		<li>The (optional) dependency on Valgrind is gone. It was used for
			running leak detection during unit test execution, but
			the unit tests were for the C++ framework.
		<li>The (optional) dependency on doxygen is gone. It was used for
			building documentation of the source code in the
			C++ framework.
		<li>Automatic generation of machine and component documentation
			is gone (<tt>make documentation</tt>).
		<li>In summary: the <tt>doc/</tt> sub-directory is now just static
			content, nothing is generated at build time.
	</ul>
</ul>



<p><br>Please read the HISTORY file for more details.

<p>To build the emulator, run the <tt>configure</tt> script, and then run 
<tt>make</tt>. This should hopefully work on most Unix-like systems, with few
or no modifications to the source code.

<p>Regarding files in the <tt>src/include/thirdparty/</tt> directory:
most of these are from other open source projects such as NetBSD. See individual
source files for details, if you plan to redistribute GXemul in binary form,
or reuse the source code.
