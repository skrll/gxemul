<p>The CATS emulation mode is working well enough to run
old versions of <a href="#netbsdcatsinstall">NetBSD/cats</a> and
<a href="#openbsdcatsinstall">OpenBSD/cats</a>.</p>

<p><font color="red"><small><a name="#debiancats">Debian GNU/Linux</a></small></font> could
perhaps run in the future.

<p>Known issue: Clocks inside the emulated guest OS run at the wrong pace.

<h3>NetBSD/cats:</h3>

<p>It is possible to install and run
<a href="http://www.netbsd.org/ports/cats/">NetBSD/cats</a> in GXemul.

<p>
<a href="20051007-netbsd-cats-installed.png"><img src="20051007-netbsd-cats-installed_small.png"></a>

<p>
To install NetBSD/cats onto a disk image, follow these instructions:

<p>
<ol start="1">
  <li>Create an empty harddisk image, which will be the root disk
	that you will install NetBSD/cats onto:<pre>
	<b>dd if=/dev/zero of=nbsd_cats.img bs=1024 count=1 seek=6000000</b>

</pre>
  <li>Download the NetBSD/cats ISO image and the generic and install kernels:<pre>
	<a href="ftp://ftp.de.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/iso/8.0/NetBSD-8.0-cats.iso">ftp://ftp.de.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/iso/8.0/NetBSD-8.0-cats.iso</a>
	<a href="ftp://ftp.de.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-8.0/cats/binary/kernel/netbsd-GENERIC.aout.gz">ftp://ftp.de.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-8.0/cats/binary/kernel/netbsd-GENERIC.aout.gz</a>
	<a href="ftp://ftp.de.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-8.0/cats/binary/kernel/netbsd-INSTALL.aout.gz">ftp://ftp.de.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-8.0/cats/binary/kernel/netbsd-INSTALL.aout.gz</a>

</pre>
  <p>
  <li>Start the installation like this:<pre>
	<b>gxemul -X -E cats -d nbsd_cats.img -d NetBSD-8.0-cats.iso netbsd-INSTALL.aout.gz</b>

</pre>
	and proceed like you would do if you were installing NetBSD on a real
	CATS from CDROM.
</ol>

<p>Note that there may be some long delays during bootup.

<p>Alternatively, to install from FTP, you can skip downloading the ISO,
and start the install without <tt>-d xxxxx.iso</tt>. Suitable network 
settings are IP 10.0.0.1, gateway/default route 10.0.0.254, netmask 
255.0.0.0, nameserver 10.0.0.254.

<p>If everything worked, NetBSD should now be installed on the disk image.
Use the following command line to boot the emulated CATS machine:<pre>
	<b>gxemul -XEcats -d nbsd_cats.img netbsd-GENERIC.aout.gz</b>

</pre>

<h3>OpenBSD/cats:</h3>

<p>It is possible to install and run
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cats.html">OpenBSD/cats</a>
in GXemul. Unfortunately, <i>"The OpenBSD/cats port was discontinued after the 4.0 release"</i> according to
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cats.html">http://www.openbsd.org/cats.html</a>,
so from a security perspective it is not up to date, but it is still
possible to run for experimental purposes.

<p>
<a href="20051007-openbsd-cats-installed.png"><img src="20051007-openbsd-cats-installed_small.png"></a>

<p>To install OpenBSD/cats onto an emulated harddisk image,
follow these instructions:

<p>
<ol>
  <li>Create an empty harddisk image, which will be the root disk
	that OpenBSD installs itself onto:<pre>
	<b>dd if=/dev/zero of=obsd_cats.img bs=1024 count=1 seek=1900000</b>

</pre>
  <li>Download the entire cats directory from the ftp server:<pre>
	<b>wget -np -l 0 -r <a href="https://ftp.nluug.nl/OpenBSD/4.0/cats/">https://ftp.nluug.nl/OpenBSD/4.0/cats/</a></b>
	<b>cp ftp.nluug.nl/OpenBSD/4.0/cats/bsd .</b>
	<b>cp ftp.nluug.nl/OpenBSD/4.0/cats/bsd.rd .</b>

</pre>
	(Replace ftp.se.openbsd.org with a server closer to you, for
	increased download speed.)
  <p>
  <li>You now need to make an ISO image of the entire directory you downloaded.
	(I recommend using <tt>mkisofs</tt> for that purpose. If you don't
	already have <tt>mkisofs</tt> installed on your system, you need
	to install it in order to do this.)<pre>
	<b>mkisofs -allow-lowercase -o openbsd_cats_4.0.iso ftp.nluug.nl/OpenBSD/</b>
	<b>rm -rf ftp.nluug.nl</b>      <i>(this directory is not needed anymore)</i>

</pre>
  <li>Start the emulator using this command line:<pre>
	<b>gxemul -XEcats -d obsd_cats.img -d openbsd_cats_4.0.iso bsd.rd</b>

</pre>
	and proceed like you would do if you were installing OpenBSD
	on a real CATS. (Install onto <tt>wd0</tt>, <i>don't</i> configure the
	network, install from CD.)
</ol>

<p>(Although it <i>is</i> possible to configure the network, IPv4 address 
10.0.0.1, netmask 255.0.0.0, gateway/default route 10.0.0.254, and 
nameserver 10.0.0.254, the userland NAT-like networking layer is not 
stable enough yet to support a full install via ftp.)

<p><b>NOTE:</b> Make sure that you <tt>sync</tt> and <tt>reboot</tt>
correctly once the installation is finished, or the <tt>/dev</tt> nodes 
may not have been written correctly to disk.

<p>Once the install has finished, the following command should let you 
boot from the harddisk image:

<p><pre>
	<b>gxemul -XEcats -d obsd_cats.img bsd</b>

</pre>

<h3>Debian GNU/Linux for CATS:</h3>

<p>Debian GNU/Linux for CATS (ARM) could potentially run in GXemul, however:

<ul>
  <li>The DEC 21143 NIC is not emulated well enough for Linux to accept it.
  <li>Development of Debian for CATS seems to have died? The latest
	install kernel is quite old.
</ul>

<p><font color="#ff0000">THIS DOES <b>NOT</b> WORK YET!</font>

<p>The following installation instructions would theoretically work:

<p>
<ol>
  <li>Create an empty harddisk image, which will be the root disk
	that Debian installs itself onto:<pre>
	<b>dd if=/dev/zero of=debian_cats.img bs=1024 count=1 seek=3300000</b>

</pre>
  <li>Download the tftpboot install kernel:<pre>
	<a href="http://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/oldstable/main/disks-arm/current/cats/tftpboot.img">http://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/oldstable/main/disks-arm/current/cats/tftpboot.img</a>

</pre>
  <li>Start the installation using the following command line:<pre>
	<b>gxemul -XEcats -d debian_cats.img tftpboot.img</b>

</pre>
</ol>

<p>It doesn't work, though, because the NIC isn't working well enough.

<p>The only use of Debian/CATS in the emulator right now is as a way to
manipulate Linux disk images, if you are on a non-Linux host. By choosing
"Execute a shell" in the installer's menu, you can have access to tools such as
fdisk and mke2fs, which are useful for creating Linux paritions on disk images.
