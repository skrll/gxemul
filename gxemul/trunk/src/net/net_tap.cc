 *  Support for Ethernet tap interfaces.
 *
 *  A single tap instance is used for the entire simulated network.
 *  We treat this as sort of virtual Ethernet switch, with the tap
 *  being the upstream port.  This is very simple, conceptually, and
 *  fits in nicely with the rest of the network simulation model in
 *  GXemul.
 *
 *  Use of the tap interface is completely optional, but if it is used
 *  the all of the virtual IP network support is bypassed completely.
