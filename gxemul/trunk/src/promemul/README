(P)ROM and BIOS emulation in GXemul:
------------------------------------

The general philosophy that applies to PROM/BIOS emulation is that no raw 
binary dumps of real ROMs should be included in GXemul. It is nicer to 
emulate in software only those parts of a machine's ROM or BIOS that are
actually necessary to boot an operating system.

This directory contains software emulation of various PROMs and BIOSes.

(Note: Running actual PROM dumps may also be possible in a few cases.
Using the -Q command line option disables GXemul's software emulation
of the PROM and allows raw PROM dumps to be used.)
